"""Turning Markdown and AST text into comparable tokens, and finding headings in it.

Two things live here because they are the same problem seen twice: the partition
checks compare text that crossed a format boundary, and the splitter has to find
headings in text that a writer wrapped.

**Why a token stream and not a string compare.** The AST is word-granular and the
Markdown is a *rendering* of it — emphasis marked, entities resolved, lines
wrapped at 72 columns, citations expanded, HTML injected. Nothing survives a byte
compare. What does survive is the sequence of words, and a *contiguous run* of
words is what tells a dropped abstract from a restated one: an abstract shares a
body's vocabulary, so set overlap scores it present, and shares none of the
body's phrasing, so a run does not.

**The two normalizations are deliberately not one function.** ``plain_tokens``
reads text that is already plain — the ``Str`` values of an AST inline stream.
``markdown_tokens`` reads a rendering and has to undo what the writer did to it:
strip tags, drop the math it re-spelled, unescape, unwrap autolinks and inline
link targets. Running the Markdown side's undo over plain text is what
*mis*-normalizes it — a bibliography DOI holding a literal ``<`` is read as an
open tag and eats the rest of the entry. Both ends then agree on one last pass,
:func:`_split`, which is where emphasis and quotation marks are deleted rather
than merely trimmed: ``*rate*-limited`` and ``rate-limited`` are one word, and
whether a quotation mark is inside or outside a word is the writer's business.

**Verbatim content is tokenized verbatim.** It holds maths or raw source, and the
undo pass would read a ``<`` in ``\\det J_+ > 0`` as a tag. It is also the one
place a token stream must stay byte-faithful, because point 9's claim is about
maths surviving. So the scan splits the document at its verbatim spans first and
each side is tokenized by its own rule.

**The writer spells verbatim two ways and both are it.** A fence carries an info
string, so the gfm writer reaches for one where a ``CodeBlock`` has attributes to
put there and writes an attribute-less one *indented* instead — which is every
``verbatim`` environment an author wrote. A scan that knows only the fence hands
the indented spelling to the undo pass, where ``_`` is deleted as an emphasis
mark: ``interleavedDA_MSRR`` on the AST side against ``interleavedDAMSRR`` on the
rendering's, and check A reports a code block nothing dropped.

#: A fenced block's opening or closing marker, at any indentation. A list item's
#: own content column is where its fence opens, and that is four spaces in for a
#: single ``1.  `` marker and deeper for a nested one — so the three-space bound
#: CommonMark puts on a *top-level* fence is not the bound here, and a pattern
#: carrying it sees no fence inside any list at all. The indentation is the
#: item's, not the fence's content: :func:`fenced_blocks` takes it back off.
_FENCE = re.compile(r"^( *)(`{3,}|~{3,})")

#: How far past its container's content column a line has to sit to be an
#: indented code block. CommonMark's four.
_CODE_INDENT = 4

#: A list item's marker and the gap after it, whose end is the content column the
#: item opens. That column is what an indented code block inside the item is
#: measured from, and it is why indentation alone decides nothing: pandoc writes
#: ``1.  `` and a second paragraph of that item then sits at the same four
#: columns a top-level code block does.
_LIST_MARKER = re.compile(r"^ *(?:[-*+]|\d+[.)]) +")

#: A blockquote's own markers. Point 12's labelled blockquotes hold maths and
#: raw HTML, and a fence inside one opens with ``> `` — unrecognised, its LaTeX
#: is read as prose and the ``>`` in ``\\det J > 0`` is taken for a tag that eats
#: the sentence after it. Stripping the marker is token-neutral either way: a
#: lone ``>`` is punctuation and trims to nothing.
_QUOTE = re.compile(r"^ {0,3}(?:> ?)+")

#: An ATX heading line. The gfm writer emits every heading in this form.
_ATX = re.compile(r"^ {0,3}(#{1,6})\s+(.*?)\s*#*\s*$")

_FOOTNOTE_REF = re.compile(r"\[\^[^\]\s]*\]")
_MATH_SPAN = re.compile(r"\$`.*?`\$", re.DOTALL)
#: A whole MathML element, dropped the way a math span is. Point 9's one
#: exception emits a caption's maths as MathML, and that element spells the same
#: maths twice — once as presentation glyphs, once as the LaTeX annotation. The
#: tag pass alone leaves both behind as bare text glued to the word after them,
#: so a caption reading ``The <math>…8…</math>-qubit`` tokenizes as ``88-qubit``
#: and no AST run can match it; the AST spells the element once, as a ``Math``
#: node its neighbouring ``Str`` runs stop either side of.
_MATH_ELEMENT = re.compile(r"<math\b.*?</math\s*>", re.DOTALL)
#: An inline code span, padded so that it is a token boundary. ``walk``'s runs
#: break at a ``Code`` and hold none of its content, while the writer spells the
#: span against whatever touches it — a macro expanding to ``\\texttt`` written
#: against the next word arrives as ``` `A7`-directed ```, one token here
#: against a run beginning ``directed`` there, and check A reports a paragraph
#: nothing dropped. The content **stays**, unlike a math span's: check B compares
#: this stream against itself, so deleting a code span would be a splitter
#: dropping one with nothing left to notice.
#:
#: One backtick and no line break, measured rather than assumed — of the staged
#: corpus's 993 inline spans none is written with a longer run and none is
#: wrapped. The pass runs after :data:`_MATH_SPAN`, which is the one thing the
#: writer spells with backticks *and* wraps.
_CODE_SPAN = re.compile(r"`[^`\n]*`")
_AUTOLINK = re.compile(r"<((?:https?|ftp|mailto):[^<>\s]*)>")
#: An inline link's target, dropped so the link reads as its own text. A URL
#: holds no whitespace, so the chunk between ``](`` and the last ``)`` on it is
#: the target however many parentheses the URL itself carries.
_LINK_TARGET = re.compile(r"\]\(\S*\)")
_TAG = re.compile(r"<[^<>]*>", re.DOTALL)
_ESCAPE = re.compile(r"\\([^0-9A-Za-z\s])")

#: Characters deleted wherever they sit. Emphasis and quotation are the writer's
#: marks on a word, not part of it, and the AST spells neither.
_DELETED = str.maketrans("", "", "*_~\u201c\u201d\u2018\u2019\"'")

#: Characters trimmed from a token's ends only — punctuation that attaches to a
#: word without being in it. Kept mid-token, where a hyphen or a slash is
#: structure (``rate-limited``, ``zombie/calcified``).
_EDGES = "`()[]{}<>.,;:!?|\\/#$&+=-\u2013\u2014\u2026"

#: Placeholders for an escaped angle bracket, so the tag pass cannot read a
#: literal ``<`` in the text as the start of one.
_ESCAPED_LT, _ESCAPED_GT = "\x01", "\x02"

#: A character reference, named or numeric, **with its semicolon**. Raw HTML the
#: writer emits — a ``<figcaption>``, a ``<td>`` — is XML text, so a caption's
#: ``&`` arrives as ``&amp;`` and tokenizes as a word of its own that no AST run
#: has; the AST holds the character itself. Nothing wider than this is resolved,
#: because a bare ``&`` is ordinary Markdown and ``R&D`` is not a reference to
#: anything.
