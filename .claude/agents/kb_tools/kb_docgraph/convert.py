"""Stage 1 — one volume root in, the two artifacts stage 2 needs out.

**A volume root is a top-level LaTeX document, and the caller says which files
are.** Nothing here discovers: no directory walk, no glob, no inference about
which of a directory's ``.tex`` files are roots. A file reached by ``\\input`` is
not a volume and is never named on its own — it arrives as part of the volume
that includes it. Naming one alongside its includer converts the same content
twice and no per-volume check can see it, because neither volume can see the
other's copy. The reverse costs more than duplication: a fragment converted alone
renders its includer's macros unexpanded, so it is not merely repeated, it is
wrong.

**The working directory is the volume's own, on every invocation.** Pandoc
resolves ``\\input`` against the invoking process's directory rather than the
source file's, and ``--resource-path`` does not cover it. Converted from anywhere
else a volume loses its own parts to a stderr warning and **exit 0**. This is the
one loss mode the pipeline can cause by itself, which is why it is a requirement
here rather than a note about pandoc.

**One pandoc failure is recoverable here and the rest are stops.** A
``--bibliography`` the reader cannot parse is the input point 10 says a corpus
may not have, so the volume is converted again as though it had none and the
files are carried out on the :class:`Volume` for the build to report. An
unparseable source is not that, and nothing here catches
:exc:`pandoc.PandocError` at large. An include the reader could not load is a
stop as well — it is caught only to name the volume it was lost from, and
re-raised as itself.

**Two transforms, at two different moments, and the distinction is not
cosmetic.** :func:`strip_environment_declarations` runs on the source *before*
pandoc parses, because pandoc expands a declared environment during parsing and
by the time any filter runs the author's name for it is gone. The reshaping of
those environments into labelled blockquotes is a Lua filter and runs *after*
parsing, when there is a Div to reshape. A filter cannot do the first job and the
pre-pass cannot do the second.

**Neither source reading refuses.** Both pre-scan author markup held to no fixed
standard, so a form they do not recognise is an ordinary input and not an
exception: an unreadable ``\\newtheorem`` display name is left out of the
mapping, and an unreadable ``\\newenvironment`` declaration is left where it was
written and named on the :class:`Volume`. Each costs its own declaration — the
blocks of that environment arrive as the author defined them rather than as
labelled blockquotes carrying a name — and neither costs the build.

:func:`theorem_display_names` is a third reading of the source, and it is here
for the same reason the first one is: pandoc consumes the preamble, so a
``\\newtheorem`` declaration reaches no filter — not as a ``RawBlock``, not in
``meta``, not as an attribute on the Div pandoc classes with the declaration's
*internal* name. The declaration's second string is the one that says what the
block is, so it is read here and handed to the filter as metadata
(``pandoc.THEOREM_NAMES_FLAG``).

**A declaration this reading cannot see costs the display name and nothing
else.** The scan is over the volume root's own text, so a preamble reached by
``\\input`` — or one a document class supplies, as ``amsthm`` supplies
``proof`` — yields no mapping and the filter falls back to the internal name.
That is the label every block carried before this reading existed, and stage B's
census is where the name surfaces.

Both artifacts carry the same filter set and the same mapping, so their header
sequences agree — which is the property stage 2 asserts before it zips them —
and so a label word reaches both sides of the check that compares the AST's text
against the rendering's.
