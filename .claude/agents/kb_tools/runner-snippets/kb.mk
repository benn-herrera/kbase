# KB maintenance targets. This file is installed at
# <harness-dir>/agents/kb_tools/runner-snippets/ — <harness-dir> being the
# project's .claude or .opencode — and is included from the consuming
# project's Makefile by one installed line (never copied into it), e.g.
#
#     -include .claude/agents/kb_tools/runner-snippets/kb.mk
#
# The line is managed by the installer (run from the consumer root):
#     PYTHONPATH=<harness-dir>/agents python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util install-targets
# The non-fatal `-include` form is deliberate: if the installed tree is
# absent — not yet installed, or removed — the consumer's Makefile keeps
# working and only these KB targets go missing.
#
# Assumed consumer layout: the repo root (where make runs) contains kb-root/
# and <harness-dir>/agents, which holds the kb_tools package. KB_PY_ENV's
# PYTHONPATH is that agents directory, found from this fragment's own
# location: the last word of MAKEFILE_LIST is this file only while it is being
# read, so KB_SNIPPET_DIR is expanded immediately (:=) and before anything
# else is included. The tools are stdlib-only and run under the system
# python3.
#
# Target names carry a `kb-` prefix and variables a `KB_` prefix, so neither
# collides with a project's own verify/refresh/stats. Plain POSIX recipe
# lines — no SHELL override; existing recipes keep their own shell.
#
# Targets:
#   kb-verify          verify KB link integrity and claim-graph metadata
#   kb-refresh         refresh mechanically maintained KB metadata
#   kb-stats           print KB claim-graph stats
#   kb-build           launch a detached KB build over SOURCES="a.tex b.tex"
#   kb-build-await     block until the detached build's card changes or it exits
#   kb-build-kill      TERM the detached build's driver

# Composite, not sequential: both verifiers run, and the target carries the

# cover one verifier's faults while the other's stayed invisible until it went
# green. One continued line is one shell invocation, which is what lets the rc
# be collected instead of enforced per line. The verifiers label their own
# output ([verify-md-links], [claim-quality]), so suppressing the echo costs
# the report nothing.
