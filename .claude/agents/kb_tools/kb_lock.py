"""The KB's advisory locks, shared with kbase: one write lock, and one build's run lock.

**The write lock** is an exclusive ``flock`` on the directory that holds
``kb-root/`` — the repository root, the same directory kbase locks, so a writer
from either toolchain excludes a writer from the other. A writer takes it before
it reads the KB and holds it until its last write; a second writer that cannot
take it within the wait gets :class:`LockBusy` and nothing is read or written.
Readers take no lock.

**The run lock** is an exclusive ``flock`` on ``<git dir>/kbase-build.lock``,
held by a running build for its whole life and recording the build's
state directory. While it is held and names one, a command that writes the KB is
refused (:func:`command_write_lock`); held but empty, the build is starting and
has not yet waited out the writers in flight (:func:`await_writers`), so a
writer may go ahead.

Both are the kernel's: released when the holding process exits, by any route,
``kill -9`` included. There is no stale lock to judge or clear; the run lock's
file is removed by its holder on the way out only so that it stands while held.

**Windows has no advisory lock.** Where ``fcntl`` is absent nothing is locked
and nothing reads as held: the only guard against a concurrent writer is the
read-then-compare check each write makes on the file it replaces, two writers
can still interleave across files, a running build is not observable, and one
writer at a time is the operator's to keep.

Stdlib only.
