"""Where this toolchain is installed, read off the package's own path.

kb_tools runs installed under a coding-agent harness's project directory —
``<project>/.claude/agents/kb_tools`` or ``<project>/.opencode/agents/kb_tools``
— and that directory decides every harness-named path the toolchain spells: the
PYTHONPATH entry a consumer's command line carries, the include line its runner
file holds, and the project's scratch directory. :func:`current` finds it by
walking up from this file to the nearest ancestor carrying a harness
directory's name.

Paths are taken as the import system gave them, never resolved: a tree reached
through a symlinked ``agents/`` is located at the link, which is where its
consumer named it.

The consuming repository's root is not read here; it stays cwd-anchored
(``kb_util.find_repo_root``). Stdlib only.
