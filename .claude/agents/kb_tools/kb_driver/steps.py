"""The ordered step table — the only place that says what happens next.

The pipeline sequence as data. No brief template and no dispatched seat ever
names a stage id, a record command, or a successor step; the rows below are the
sequencer, and everything else in the driver reads them. The
guard is ``prompt_templates.lint`` run over :data:`TEMPLATE_PROHIBITIONS`, which also
carries the metadata markers — the other thing a brief may never spell.

What this module holds: rows, their call unit and system prompt, the template and the
per-call slots the run loop must compute, the artifacts the contract check
looks for, and the barriers a row can raise. What it must not hold: subprocess
calls, file writes, or template text. Stage order comes from ``kb_pipeline``
and is never restated here.

**Scope**: the rows below cover every stage of the pipeline, and a run walks all
of them. :data:`TABLE_STAGE_IDS` is sliced from ``kb_pipeline.STAGE_IDS`` so it
cannot disagree with the stage vocabulary about order or membership.

Executing a row is the run loop's job. This module is a table.

Stdlib only.
