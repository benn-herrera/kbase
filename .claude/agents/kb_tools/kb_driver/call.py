"""Call **policy**: transport retry, contract validation, the one re-ask, persistence.

The driver's half of one call. The transport is ``inference.call_chat`` — one
tool-less chat-completions request to the server the environment names — and
it is :attr:`Caller.transport`, injected, so a suite can stand a scripted reply
in its place. It classifies how a request ended and applies no policy. This
module is that policy, and owns everything downstream of the classification:

* **Retry.** A request that did not complete is retried on ``[retry]
  transport_attempts`` with ``backoff_seconds``; exhaustion is exit 12. An
  environment the transport refuses is exit 14 and is not retried: the fault is
  in the environment the run was launched in, and the same request fails the
  same way every time.
* **Contract validation — existence and structure only.** Declared artifacts
  exist and are non-empty, and a returned text the driver persists holds no
  line a passage may not: a heading, a list item, a table row, a code fence, a
  Markdown link or a ``.md`` path, any of which would corrupt the document the
  text is substituted into. Never content quality.
* **The one re-ask.** A contract failure re-asks the *same* step once — the
  same template, with the row's correction alternative chosen and the rejected
  lines quoted verbatim in it where there are any, the unchanged brief where
  there are none. A second failure is exit 17, naming the step and the
  complaint. It is not a barrier: no pre-supplied answer can resolve a step
  that cannot produce its declared output shape twice. The re-ask's words are
  the fragment's; this module supplies the lines and nothing else.
* **Persistence, one route plus its absence.** ``driver`` — the returned text
  *is* the artifact, and this module writes it to a contract path the model
  never chose, through a temp and a rename so the path never holds bytes nobody
  finished writing. ``—`` is a row that leaves nothing behind and must declare
  no artifact.

**The driver process never writes under ``kb-root/``.** Its writes from here
are the composed brief and the call's capture in the run directory, and the
driver-persisted artifact under the scratch layout root — the last held by a
boundary check rather than by convention.

**What this module deliberately does not do.** It parses what a return declares
and hands it back. It counts nothing about rounds, caps, or position, and it
selects no successor.

**Dependency note.** ``call`` depends on ``{inference, prompt_templates, runlog,
config}``. Naming an exit code additionally requires ``baton``, and executing a
row requires ``steps`` — both leaves, both imported for the reason
``ledger.py`` states for ``baton``: copying those constants here would be
exactly the drift single-sourcing exists to prevent. The atomic write is
``kb_survey.manifest.write_text_atomic``, the toolchain's own, imported for the
same reason — a second implementation of a write that must not tear is a second
thing to get right.

Stdlib only.
