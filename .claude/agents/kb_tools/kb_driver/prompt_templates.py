"""Prompt composition: template load, strict slot fill, persistence, lint.

Templates ship beside the code at ``kb_driver/prompt-templates/*.tmpl.md`` and are
anchored by ``__file__`` — the package-resource exception
``kb_pipeline.installed_template`` already makes; repo and KB paths stay
cwd-anchored. Bodies are the prompt engineer's; this module is the machinery
that loads, composes, persists, and lints them, and it never chooses which
template to use — its callers do: the step table for the driver's own calls, and
:mod:`kb_tools.kb_claimgraph.ask` for the claim-graph inference asks, whose
composed prompts land in that build's own workspace rather than through
:func:`persist`.

**A slot is spelled** ``@!slot-name!@``, the same marker grammar ``gen_defs``
renders the agent-definition templates with — delimiters and name class alike
(:data:`SLOT_NAME`) — so a model reading either surface reads one syntax. The
delimiter is polar rather than symmetric because an
unclosed opener is then unambiguous: :func:`slots_of` refuses any ``@!`` or
``!@`` that does not parse as a marker and names the line, which a symmetric
delimiter cannot do — its unclosed opener pairs silently with the next marker's
opening. A brace is only a brace here: a JSON example, a shell ``${VAR}`` or a
``\\frac{a}{b}`` reaches the model as written.

**A namespace routes the slot; the name never does.** ``@!dyn.<name>!@`` is
filled from the caller's per-call data and from nowhere else, and ``@!<name>!@``
from the composer's own sources — constants, fragments, alternatives — and from
nowhere else. :data:`DYNAMIC_PREFIX` sits outside the name
class, so a namespace can never be mistaken for a name and a name can never claim
one. What that buys is a hole that declares what it is in the artifact: these
templates are read and edited by agents holding no repository context, and the
plausible helpful edit to a marker indistinguishable from prose is to inline the
literal it stands for — which is exactly the divergence a slot exists to prevent,
the parser matching against the same constant. It buys the composer the same
thing: neither source can shadow the other, so the collision is not checked but
absent, and a miswiring is reported as the mistake it is rather than as an
unfilled slot here and an unused value there.

**Composition is strict in both directions.** Every slot a template (or a
fragment it pulls in) declares must have a value, and every value the caller
supplies must be used. A violation is a boundary check failure —
:class:`runlog.BoundaryError`, exit 15 — because only driver code writes the
step table and only the PE writes the templates: a disagreement between them
is a defect, never a pipeline outcome.

**What a bare slot is filled from**, and the distinction is what keeps prose and
code single-sourced:

* *constants* — the pool a template draws on only where a slot names it, so one
  pool serves every template that names an entry of it. The caller supplies the
  pool: today that is ``kb_claimgraph.ask``'s ``LETTER_SLOTS``, the answer
  letters whose parse matches against the same constants;
* *fragments* — the shared fragments, resolved here from :data:`FRAGMENTS` by
  loading the file under ``fragments/`` and rendering it first, so a contract
  several templates carry is one chunk injected by the composer rather than a
  restatement per template;
* *alternatives* — the same directory's caller-selected pieces, registered per
  slot in :data:`ALTERNATIVE_SLOTS`. The caller passes a **choice** — one
  registered name, or ``None`` where the slot admits an empty fill — and the
  composer resolves it exactly as it resolves a fragment. A caller holding the
  chosen body's prose would be prose reaching a model from application code, so
  the name is what travels.

A fragment and an alternative each resolve **one level deep**: the slots the
resolved body declares join the required set and are filled from these same
sources, and a resolved body naming a fragment or an alternative slot of its own
is refused.

Stdlib only.
