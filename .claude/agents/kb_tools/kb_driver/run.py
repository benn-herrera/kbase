"""The outer loop: stage iteration, step execution, resume, exit selection.

The sequencer. It walks ``steps.py``'s table in order, computes each row's
per-call slots, hands calls to ``call.py``, records stages through
``ledger.py``, raises registry barriers through ``barriers.py``, and chooses the
exit code the run ends on. It holds no template text, constructs no subprocess,
and reads no TOML.

**Nothing a later stage reads is carried in an attribute.**
:data:`RUNNER_ATTRIBUTES` is the closed set a :class:`Runner` may hold and is
where the criterion that admits one is stated; everything else is re-derived at
the point of use, the way ``_recorded`` is re-read from the ledger and the way
``seed.graph-init`` asks the working tree which runner file it carries.

**Position comes from the ledger, and from nothing else.** A recorded stage is
not re-walked and an unrecorded one is walked from its first row, so what a
resume re-runs is everything the last boundary does not account for — including
work whose artifact is sitting on disk. That is the discard rule rather than a
lost optimization: an artifact no boundary accounts for cannot be told from one
a dying process half-earned, and the stage table is what makes discarding it
cheap, every row that spends a model call standing immediately in front of its
own boundary (``steps.STEPS``; SPEC.md, The Driver's Contract).

**A launch is an invocation that finds ``start`` unrecorded, and nothing
configures that.** There is no build-mode setting and no row states a mode it
belongs to: the ledger's recorded-stage set is read at the top of every walk and
is the whole of what says where this invocation stands. The one place the
distinction is acted on is :meth:`Runner._pre_kb_root`, a row of the ``start``
stage — so it runs on a launch and never on a resume, by the same skip that
makes a recorded stage unwalked — where a ``kb-root/`` holding documents this
build did not write refuses rather than being overwritten.

**Nothing here counts a call, and no call's number is read back off disk.** A
stage's rows are a fixed sequence, so what a stage spent is what its rows are,
and its ledger entry says every one of them is behind it. A file an earlier
process left under the scratch layout is
therefore not a spent anything — it is work no boundary accounts for, and the
row that really runs overwrites it.

**Barriers are exits.** Nothing here blocks on a human. A raise persists the
barrier record, relays it, and ends the walk with the registry's exit code; the
answer arrives on the next invocation. A barrier answered from config or
``--decide`` resumes the walk in place, and a second raise of the same pair in
one process is an automatic stop.

**No row grades what it writes.** Every rigor value and every on-point fraction
a minting row authors is the unscored literal, and stays it: the build authors
the graph and the maintenance tooling scores it, through its own front door.
``*pending*`` is the expected terminal state, and nothing here refuses it. No
row of this table mints anything, either: the three ``kb_claimgraph``
invocations mint mechanically, inside the tool, checked by that tool's own gate
and by ``phase-3a``'s verify coverage.

**No stage repairs a gate.** ``phase-3a`` runs the build-time check and either
records or stops: what each of them compares is one mechanically-produced
artifact against another, so a red one is a defect in a tool or in what was
authored and there is nothing for a model to remediate in the KB.

**Scope**: the walk covers :data:`steps.TABLE_STAGE_IDS` — every stage of the
pipeline. ``execute`` still takes the stage list, because a test that means to
exercise one stage's rows should not have to walk every other stage to reach
them; exit 0 means every stage walked is recorded.

**One flag bounds the walk, and a bounded run is not a failed one.**
``--through`` names the last stage to walk, cut in :meth:`Runner._walk`.
Reaching it is exit :data:`baton.EXIT_BOUNDED`: the ledger stands where the
walk stopped and the next invocation resumes there.

**``--no-inference`` excludes rows and bounds nothing.** Every row that would
cost a model call is dropped by :meth:`Runner._applies` — a property the rows
derive (``steps.Step.spends_inference``) rather than a stage id anything here
names — and the walk carries on past it, so the build closes out. The boundary
commit of a stage that lost rows says so (:meth:`Runner._stage_note`), and the
record carries the same flag onward so the ledger's own coverage check knows
what kind of build it is recording. A bounded run stops and resumes; a build
spending no inference is finished without those rows.

Stdlib only.

#: Every attribute a :class:`Runner` may hold, and the whole of it.
#:
#: **The criterion is the stage boundary.** A resume re-enters the walk at one —
#: a recorded stage is never re-walked, and an unrecorded stage is walked from
#: its first row — so an attribute one row writes is read *stale* by a later
#: invocation exactly when its reader runs in a different stage from its writer.
#: Inside one stage there is no process boundary to lose a value across; across
#: two there always is. An attribute is therefore admissible on exactly three
#: grounds, and a name is added here only by naming which of them it stands on:
#:
#: * **the invocation fixes it**, so the invocation that resumes fixes it the
#:   same way — the constructor's arguments, and ``scratch``, computed from one;
#: * **every reader runs in the writer's own stage**, so no resume observes it —
#:   ``_seq``, whose readers are the call it numbers;
#: * **the walk re-derives it before any row reads it** — ``_recorded``, re-read
#:   from the ledger at the top of :meth:`Runner.run`.
#:
#: Anything else is resumption state and has no home here: re-derive it at the
#: point of use. ``seed.graph-init`` asking ``kb_util.detected_runner`` is that
#: shape; the same answer carried from ``pre.preflight``, two stages earlier, was
#: the defect it replaced — a resume skips ``start``, so the attribute held its
#: constructor default and the ``spine-seed.runner-choice`` barrier could not
#: fire on any invocation that resumed.
#:
#: Closure is all a machine can check here; which ground an attribute stands on
#: is the author's reading, and this registry is where it is stated.
#: :meth:`Runner._check_attributes` enforces the closure, at construction and at
#: every stage transition.

        verifier compares one mechanically-produced artifact against another —
        every edge resolving among the claims that exist, the graph acyclic, the
        derived index against the authored bytes — so a red one is a defect in a
        tool or in what was authored, and neither is answered by rewriting the
        KB. The verifiers' whole report reaches the run log at INFO
        (``ledger._gate_step``); what reaches the card is which step failed,
        every verifier's return code, and the lines of its report that name the
        failure, bounded (``ledger._failure_detail``). No barrier is raised, so the card is the
        no-answer one rather than the answer-substituting one.
