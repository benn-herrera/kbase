"""Driver configuration: TOML load, typed validation, defaults.

A run is specified by a config file, by command-line flags, or by both:
:func:`load` takes an optional path and a mapping of ``[run]`` overrides, and
either may be empty. Defaults live here, which is what lets a launch carry
nothing but ``--source``, the one field with no default. Every rejection raises
:class:`ConfigError`, which ``cli`` translates to exit 13 — validation happens
at load, before anything runs, so a typo cannot become a mid-build stop three
hours in, and a flag is refused in the same words its config key would be.

**A flag wins over the file for the field it names.** The command line is the
more specific statement of one run, and it is the precedence ``--decide``
already has over the ``[barriers.*]`` tables — one rule for both doors rather
than a rule per door. A repeated ``--source`` replaces the configured list
outright rather than extending it: a merge would leave no way to say "these
sources and not the file's".

**Nothing here names the server a model call goes to, or its model.** Every
call is ``inference.call_chat``, which reads both from the environment the run
is launched from; a section or key that once named a CLI command, a permission
mode or a total call bound is refused as unknown, like any other nothing reads.

Barrier decisions arrive through two doors with one vocabulary — the
``[barriers.<stage>.<kind>]`` config tables and the repeatable
``--decide <stage>.<kind>=<answer>[:<free text>]`` — so an operator
answer and a config answer cannot diverge in form. Both are checked against
the barrier registry's admissible answers when one is supplied; the registry
lives in ``barriers.py`` and is injected rather than imported, since config
load sits below it in the dependency direction.

**There is no build-mode setting, and the key that carried one is refused.** A
build is either a launch or a resume, and a resume is not configured — it is
what a ledger with recorded stages already says, re-derived from the ledger on
every invocation. A setting whose vocabulary has one member is a question with
one answer, so ``[run] build_mode``, its vocabulary and its default are deleted
outright rather than kept as a single-valued vestige. It needs no key of its
own to be refused by, because **every key :func:`load` does not read is
refused, naming its section and the key** — in ``[run]``, ``[timeouts]``,
``[retry]`` and ``[log]`` alike, and a section nothing reads is refused the same
way, by name. An unknown key is never inert:
a file that still carries one means something by it, and silently ignoring it
would walk a different build than the file asks for. ``[barriers]`` is checked
differently because it is the one section with a vocabulary to check
against — the registry's own registered pairs, below.

**One field says what a run is made of; one bounds how far it goes.**
``no_inference`` drops every row that would cost a model call, row by row, and
the walk carries on past them to a finished build. ``through`` names the last
stage to walk, by stage id or by the stage's own display name, resolved here to
an id so nothing downstream deals in two spellings. The first is rendered back
into the resume line and the second is not.

A stage id containing a dot must be quoted in TOML — e.g. ``[barriers."phase-1.5".some-kind]``
— because TOML reads an unquoted dot as another level of table nesting. No
stage id today has one, but the vocabulary does not promise that it never will.

Stdlib only.
