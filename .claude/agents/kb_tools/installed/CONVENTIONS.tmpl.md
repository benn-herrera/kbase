# CONVENTIONS — {project-name} knowledge base

How to behave when operating on this knowledge base. The formats it conforms to are the toolchain's
own — every metadata byte here was composed by a `kb_util` write op from values a seat supplied, and
an op refuses values it cannot render and read back. This file is conduct, not format.

## What this tree is

Two graphs over one tree of Markdown files, beside which sit the images leaves embed, under
`assets/` directories. The **topography graph** is the navigation hierarchy: entry point, domain
indexes, subtopic indexes, leaves. The **claim graph** is a graph over results, of node kinds
{node-kinds}, registered in `claim-quality.md` files — the framework kinds in `invariants.md`
instead (below) — and materialized under `.index/`. Its `depends` and `supports` edges close no
cycle: solidity is undefined on one, and `kb-verify` fails it. `references` and `demoted` edges
carry no solidity and may cycle. A `demoted` edge is a dependency the build cut to break a circle:
`kb-verify` lists each one as a finding, not a failure, and the `resolve-demoted` op removes one or
restores it to `depends`. A leaf is a container — its
position label says where it sits in the hierarchy and nothing about what it hosts.

Corpus invariants — notation and cross-cutting definitions — belong in `invariants.md`, which is
also the file the toolchain parses for framework nodes, so a line in it shaped like a declaration
becomes one.

## Use the agents

- `kb-docent` — reading and navigation, through `/kb-start` and `/kb-next`. Read-only on the KB;
  writes only under `session/`.
- `kb-maintainer` — every change: new leaves, corrections, frontmatter, claim-graph wiring, and the
  loop back to green.
- The build pipeline (`/kb-build`) built this tree. It is not rerun for incremental work.

Run `/kb-start` and `/kb-next` from the project root — the directory holding this KB — or from
inside the KB root itself. Those are the two invocation points the commands support; anywhere else
they stop and ask. Once a session is running, do not change directory while exploring: navigation is
the docent's job, and moving the session's ground out from under it breaks the paths it is tracking.

Working the KB without them is the failure this file exists to prevent. The constraints below are
not discoverable by reading the files, and an edit that looks right while violating one of them
either fails at the gate or passes and leaves the graph quietly wrong.

## Authored versus derived

Authored: leaf content, leaf frontmatter, register entry text, dependency membership, and local
rigor (`confidence` on a claim, `quality` on a support). Derived and regenerated: solidity, build
status, the parenthetical solidity annotations, subtree aggregates, the `Leaf references:` line in
each register entry, and everything under `.index/`. **A hand-edited derived field is a verifier
failure**, not a shortcut — the value is overwritten and the drift is reported. The claim-graph
pictures (`claim-graph*.svg` at the KB root and in volume directories) are derived too and owned by
`kb-refresh`; nothing verifies them, so never hand-edit one.

Authored does not mean typed. Everything authored except leaf prose is metadata, and metadata is
written only by the `kb_util` write ops: you supply values, the op composes the format, proves what
it wrote by reading it back, and refuses rather than writing what it cannot prove. It mints an
entry's id itself and prints it, so no id is ever chosen. The op surface, its invocation, and its
outcomes are in the CLI itself:
`PYTHONPATH=<project-root>/{agents-dir} python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util --help` lists every op with the
exit codes it reports, and `--help` on one op adds that op's own options and its closed set of value
keys. `kb_util` and the `kb-*` targets are standard-library only and run under the `python3` first
on `PATH`, which must be 3.11 or later. The toolchain's prose contracts stay in its source
repository and are not installed into a consuming project, so no document under this project root
holds them. A values file carrying a key its op does not take is refused with the offending key, its
line, and the complete set the op does take, so the call you would have made anyway is what answers
the question.

## The gate

`kb-refresh` regenerates derived state; `kb-verify` is the read-only gate. Refresh before verify,
always, and leave the gate green. Run both through this project's runner rather than invoking the
tools directly. A failure marked refresh-fixable means run refresh; anything else is a real defect
in what was authored, and re-running will not clear it. On a KB in an older metadata format,
`kb-verify` reports it stale and checks nothing else, and every write op refuses, until `kb-refresh`
migrates it. A write op or `kb-refresh` that finds another writer holding the KB's write lock exits
8 having read and written nothing; run it again unchanged.

## Where things may be written

Create files only at targets an assignment names. Output with no assigned home is a question to
raise, never a location to choose.

`AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` in this tree belong to the build, not to work done in the KB
afterwards: the toolchain stamps them at the build's validation gate — `AGENTS.md` carrying this
project's scope pin — and leaves whole whichever of them a project had already authored for itself.
Beside them the same stamp writes `CLAUDE.md` as the one line `@AGENTS.md`. No agent authors or
edits any of the three, and corpus content belongs in none — it belongs in `invariants.md`.

## Citations

In authored files — registers, indexes, summaries, `invariants.md`, and meta-docs — a reference to a
node is a structured field, a marker, or a link, never an id or a rule name sitting loose in prose.
A cited authority carries the minimal quoted excerpt that makes the citing statement falsifiable
where it stands, linked to a durable path in this tree; one clause, not the passage, because a
citation that reproduces its source has become a second copy of it. Where a reference genuinely
warrants no graph edge, the exemption is the entry's `no-edge` reason, supplied to the op that
writes the entry and standing in no other form.

The ops refuse citation values that do not take the exact shapes. `kb-verify` does not check them;
the build's own check enforces them, and it runs only inside the build.
