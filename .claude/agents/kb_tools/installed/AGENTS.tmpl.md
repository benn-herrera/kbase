# {project-name} knowledge base

This tree is a knowledge base with a verified claim graph over it. It has agents. Use them.

- **To read it** — `/kb-start` for a new topic, `/kb-next` to switch topics, run from the project
  root or from this KB root, and do not change directory once a session is under way. The docent
  navigates the hierarchy, tracks what has been covered, and pulls only what the question needs. Do
  not walk the tree yourself: it is built to be navigated, and reading it breadth-first spends
  context the answer never needed.
- **To change anything in it** — dispatch `kb-maintainer`. It calls the toolchain's metadata write
  ops, wires the claim graph, and runs the refresh-then-verify loop that has to end green.
- **Do not edit files here directly.** Every structured field was written by a tool from supplied
  values, and much of what looks editable is derived and regenerated. An edit made outside the
  maintainer is either overwritten or caught as drift.

## What this KB distills

{scope-pin}

That is this KB's scope, in the words the build was given: which corpus it distills, and which node
kinds and edge classes it populates. A leaf built from the corpus is a verbatim, mechanical
rendering of it — nothing here rewrites source text in place, so there is no version of that text
for the corpus and the KB to disagree over. Text a maintainer adds directly — a summary, a
rationale, an analysis — lives in its own place in the tree; it was never a distillation of the
corpus, so it is the KB's own word, not a claim about what the corpus says. For live node and edge
counts — what is in the graph right now, as against what this KB is for — run the project's
`kb-stats` target.

Corpus invariants — notation and cross-cutting definitions — live in `invariants.md` beside this
file. Read it before reasoning about anything here. Where there is no such file this corpus declares
none, and nothing here is waiting on it.

`CONVENTIONS.md` beside this file is the full contract: what is authored versus derived, how
metadata gets written, how citations must be formed, and what to do when the gate goes red. Read it
before any work on this KB beyond reading.
