"""KB Markdown link-integrity checker.

Crawls every `.md` file under the consuming repo's `kb-root/` (the repo root is
auto-detected by walking up from the cwd; see `kb_util.find_repo_root`; nothing
outside `kb-root/` is crawled), extracts Markdown links `[text](target)`, and
reports broken file targets, resolved against the repo root. Also folds in a
consumer-side id-validity check: hashed claim/experiment/support ids
(`clm-`/`exp-`/`sup-` + 6 [a-z0-9]) cited in prose must resolve to a node
in the KB's `claims` index stream (read through `kb_load`).

Pure standard library.

Link classification:
  - external schemes (http, https, mailto, absolute URLs) are skipped.
  - intra-repo  = resolved path stays inside the repo.
  - inter-repo  = resolved path escapes into a sibling repo (../). These are
    legitimately stale/in-flux; handling is controlled by --inter-repo.

Gating:
  Every crawled `.md` file under `kb-root/` gates: any broken intra-repo link or unknown-id
  citation flips the exit code, regardless of which file it originates from —
  there is no warn-only tier. (Crawl exclusions in `kb_links.SKIP_DIRS` /
  `kb_links.SKIP_SEGMENT_RUNS` still apply — those trees, e.g. test fixtures with
  deliberately broken links, are never scanned at all — and so does
  `kb_links.DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE_SUFFIX`, a template's links resolving only where a
  build stamps it.)

Skipped targets (never classified broken):
  - targets ending in `.tex` (a LaTeX source is a derived build artifact,
    not a navigation target),
  - targets beginning with `~` (home-dir paths like `~/.claude/...`), and
  - targets resolving INTO an `IGNORED_PATHS` dir — a project-side carveout
    for gitignored generated-artifact dirs; empty by default.

False-positive avoidance:
  - links and ids inside ``` fenced code blocks and `inline code` spans are
    NOT extracted (doc/example links live in fences).
  - a trailing `#anchor` fragment and a trailing `:linenum` suffix are stripped
    before resolving (the codebase cites locations as `path/file.md:42`).
