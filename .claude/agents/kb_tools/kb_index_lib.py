"""Foundation library for the Knowledge Base derived-index pipeline.

Pure-function parsing and record building for the ``<kb-root>/.index/*.yaml``
streams: the record shapes and field orders are the emitters below, which are
their own definition rather than a second view of one, and :data:`INDEX_FILES`
is the streams' inventory. This module is the canonical parser for
KB frontmatter, claim-quality entries, and leaf metadata; downstream tools
(``refresh_kb_metadata``, ``verify_kb_metadata``) will be unified onto it in
later phases. The library is side-effect-free with respect to KB content; the
only file I/O it performs is reading canonical sources via pathlib. A stream's
text is :func:`serialize_records`; where it lives, and reading it back, are
``kb_load``'s.

Stdlib only. No timestamps, no environment-dependent paths in emitted records.
Same canonical input -> byte-identical output.

      is a claim; ``strength`` is the conferred experimental solidity in

      is ``None``.
    * ``"rests-on"`` (gating, min-branch): ``source`` is a claim; ``target`` is
      an external work; ``strength`` is ``None`` (a work's standing is a
      property of the node, carried on :class:`ExternalWork`) and ``fraction``
      is the pairing's applicability. It is the off-graph endcap — the claim
      rests on work this corpus does not contain — and it gates: a positive
      applicability puts the target work's own ``strength`` into the source's
      ``min``, a zero one takes the pairing out of it, and either value pending
      leaves the source's derivation pending
      (:func:`compute_solidity_full`).
    * ``"references"`` (non-gating, no branch): ``source`` and ``target`` are
      both claims, and the edge records that the source's own text names the
      target — a contrast, a pointer, a *distinct from Theorem 2*. ``strength``
      and ``fraction`` are ``None``, it enters no solidity computation, and it

    A KB leaf is a **container**: it may host ANY number of ``sup`` node-bodies
    (no one-per-leaf cap). Support-ness is conferred by a leaf HOSTING a
    ``sup-id`` (parallel to how an ``exp-id`` confers experiment-ness): any
    ``kind: leaf`` container carrying one or more well-formed ``sup-id:`` keys
    originates that many support nodes, regardless of whether it
    ALSO carries ``claims:`` / ``exp-id:`` / ``no-claim:`` (orthogonal
    node-bodies). Returns ``[]`` if the file has no frontmatter, is not a
    leaf-kind container, or declares no ``sup-id``.

    The declarations are the mappings listed under ``support-nodes:``, each a
    ``sup-id`` and its ``supports`` list of ``clm-<id>: <fraction>`` beneficiary
    pairs. ``<fraction>`` is the on-point fraction f ∈ [0, 1] or the literal
    ``*pending*`` (an intended-but-unassessed edge, stored as
    PENDING_FRACTION). Each returned node carries the canonical_path/anchor/title
    from the leaf and its own ``supports`` fan-out; its ``quality`` /
    ``depends_on`` / ``rationale`` are filled in from the support's claim-quality
    entry by :func:`discover_kb`.

    Raises :class:`SupportLeafError` for a malformed ``sup-id``, a malformed
    ``supports`` claim id, an on-point fraction outside ``[0, 1]``, or a node

def compute_solidity_full(claim_entries, experiments=(), supports=(), works=()) -> dict[str, SolidityResult]:
    """Compute derivation / experimental / final solidity for every claim.

    THE definitive solidity rule — this docstring and the code below it are the
    statement of it, with no prose second view anywhere. Includes the
    DERIVATION-branch lift from support nodes. One result per
    claim with a numeric ``confidence`` OR a non-pending lift source (a run
    experiment, or a support edge with a non-pending ``sup_solidity``). A claim
    with none is fully pending and omitted (treat absence as ``*pending*``).

    Algorithm:

    * **experimental_solidity[C]** = ``max`` of ``edge.strength`` over all
      ``relation:"strengthens"`` run-experiment edges into ``C``; ``None`` if
      none. Unrun experiments contribute nothing. The MAX/experimental branch.
    * **sup_solidity[S]** (computed in unified topo order — see below) =
      ``round2(min(quality, *S's dep finals))``; pending propagates. Each
      support feeds the DERIVATION branch of its beneficiaries, never the
      experimental/max branch.
    * **local_quality[C]** = ``max(confidence[C], max over supporting sups S of
      sup_solidity[S] × f)``, where a pending ``sup_solidity`` OR a pending
      on-point fraction ``f`` (``PENDING_FRACTION``) is EXCLUDED from the max (no
      NaN, no poison). A support lift never drags a beneficiary with
      otherwise-valid quality to pending — pending flows ONLY from a claim's own
      load-bearing ``depends-on``. NOTE: the support on-point fraction ``f`` is a
      single edge-weight relevance discount (``sup_solidity × f``), NOT a chain,
      so it stays multiplicative — it is not subject to the granularity argument
      that motivates the min dep-gating below.
    * **derivation_solidity[C]** = ``round2(min(local_quality[C], *C's claim-dep
      finals, *C's work-gate strengths))`` — the weakest link in C's dependency
      cone, framework deps 1.0;
      ``None`` if ``local_quality`` is pending (confidence pending AND no support
      lift) OR any claim-dep's final is pending. So a support lift is still
      dep-gated — it does NOT bypass C's own deps the way an experiment's
      max-branch does. The dep-gate is a pure ``min`` (weakest link), not a
      product: solidity is refactor-invariant — splitting one derivation step
      into two same-quality steps must not lower it, and a deep clean chain must
      not decay toward 0 as a bookkeeping artifact (ordinal grades are not
      independent probabilities to be multiplied).
    * **final[C]** = ``max`` over the non-None of ``{derivation, experimental}``;
      ``None`` iff both are None.

    The traversal is :func:`_dependency_order`'s, over **every** claim and
    support: a claim/support is processed after every claim it depends on (so
    dep finals are known) and a claim after every support that supports it (so
    the lift is known), and a cycle anywhere in that graph raises
    :class:`SolidityCycleError` before a single value is computed. Which claims
    carry a value is decided here, afterwards, and decides nothing about which
    graphs raise. Experiments are terminal and introduce no cycles.

    **A ``rests-on`` edge joins the same ``min``, with the pairing's
    applicability deciding membership and the work's ``strength`` deciding the
    gate.** For each ``relation == "rests-on"`` edge out of claim ``C``:

    * ``fraction == 0.0`` — the work bears nothing on this claim, so the pairing
      gates nothing and is skipped before ``strength`` is even read.
    * ``fraction`` numeric and ``> 0`` — the target work's hand-authored
      ``strength`` enters ``C``'s dep-gate ``min`` exactly as a claim dep's final
      does. ``strength 0.0`` therefore gates ``C`` to ``0.0``: citing work judged
      spurious must be able to hurt.
    * ``fraction`` pending (``PENDING_FRACTION``) or absent (``None``), or the
      work's ``strength`` pending / the work absent from ``works`` — ``C``'s
      derivation is pending, poisoning exactly as a pending ``depends`` target
      does. Pending is the safe direction: a claim resting on unjudged outside
      work genuinely has unknown solidity.

    ``fraction`` is read BEFORE ``strength`` and compared explicitly: ``None``,
    ``PENDING_FRACTION`` and ``0.0`` are three distinct states that a falsiness
    test would collapse into one wrong answer. The gate is *membership times
    threshold*, never ``strength × fraction`` — that product runs the wrong way
    under a ``min`` (it makes the gate harsher as applicability falls, so a work
    judged sound-but-irrelevant would annihilate the claim), and any arithmetic
    that discounts toward 1.0 instead both treats ordinal bands as probabilities
    and produces a ``min`` operand written on no disk anywhere. The consequence
    accepted: applicability ``0.3`` and ``1.0`` gate identically.

    A work absent from ``works`` and a work present with ``strength is None``
    differ in intent and not in outcome — both are pending. This computation
    does NOT raise on the dangling target: ``refresh`` runs it before
    :func:`_assert_work_node_coverage`, which is the check that names that
    defect.

    With ``supports=()`` this reduces exactly to the prior behavior:
    ``local_quality[C] == confidence[C]`` and the support machinery is inert.
    With ``works=()`` every ``rests-on`` edge is pending-by-absent-strength.

    is non-pending (numeric). A claim with a pending final (``*pending*``) is
    OMITTED from the mapping — every consumer treats "absent" identically to
    "pending". With zero experiments, ``final == derivation`` for every claim,
    so this returns exactly the historical min-branch result.

    ``solidity = round_half_up_2dp(min(confidence, *dependency solidities))``,
    computed bottom-up over the claim depends-on DAG (Kahn topological sort):

    * A claim's dependencies are its ``depends-on`` edges. A ``claim``-target
      edge contributes that dependency's already-computed (and already-rounded)
      solidity; an ``invariant`` / ``axiom`` edge contributes ``1.0``
      (framework bedrock — solidity-1.0 by definition, never lowers the min).
    * A claim with no depends-on edges has ``solidity = confidence``.
    * The dep-gate is the *weakest link* (``min``) over the claim's own
      local quality and its dependency finals — NOT the product down the chain.
      This makes solidity refactor-invariant: splitting one derivation step
      into two same-quality steps leaves it unchanged, and a deep clean chain
      does not decay toward 0 as a granularity artifact (ordinal confidence
      grades are not independent probabilities to be multiplied).
    * Propagation uses each dependency's *rounded* solidity, so a human
      auditing ``min(0.85, 0.41, 0.28)`` against the written values gets the
      same answer the tool does.

    HARD RULE — ``*pending*`` propagates transitively, exactly like NaN
    through arithmetic. A claim's solidity is ``*pending*`` (undefined) if its
    ``confidence`` is ``*pending*`` (parsed as ``None`` — not yet quality
    assessed) OR any of its dependencies' solidity is ``*pending*``,
    REGARDLESS of the claim's own local ``confidence``. A claim with
    ``confidence: 1.0`` that depends on one pending claim still has a pending
    solidity. Framework-node dependencies (invariant / axiom targets) are
    never pending — they are solidity-1.0 bedrock by definition, so a claim
    that depends only on framework nodes is NOT pending (its solidity equals
    its confidence).

    A claim with a pending solidity is OMITTED from the returned mapping: the
    dict contains an entry only for claims with a fully-computable numeric
    solidity. Every consumer must treat "absent from this result" identically
    to "pending" — render/record it as ``*pending*`` / ``null``. The current
    KB is a closed subgraph (no numeric-confidence claim depends on a pending
    claim), so the blocked-by-pending-dependency path is dormant; it activates
    the first time a volume is assessed while a volume it depends on is still
    pending.

    Returns ``{claim_id: solidity}`` for every claim with a computable
    solidity. Raises :class:`SolidityCycleError` if the depends-on graph
    contains a cycle — over every claim, including the ones this mapping omits
    as pending, because a cycle is a property of the edges and not of the

    derived from the same state so they're internally consistent with the

    ``build_status`` / ``build_band`` are **derived** — computed by
    :func:`compute_solidity_full` from the hand-authored ``confidence`` values,
    the depends-on DAG, and run-experiment strengthens edges, NOT re-parsed
    from the claim-quality.md ``solidity`` line. ``build_status`` / ``build_band``
    derive from the FINAL solidity. A claim whose final solidity is pending
    carries ``null`` for ``solidity`` / ``build_status``.

    Field order per SCHEMA: ``source``, ``target``, ``relation``,
    ``target_kind``, ``target_solidity_recorded``, ``strength``, ``context``,
    ``fraction``. Every record carries all eight keys (schema closure); only the
    relevant ones are non-null per edge class.

    * ``depends`` edges come from claim (and now SUPPORT) Quality sections —
      ``strength:null``, ``fraction:null``. A support's own deps are ``depends``
      edges with ``source`` the sup-id.
    * ``strengthens`` edges come from each experiment leaf's ``strengthens:``
      block (``source: exp-id``, ``target: clm-id``, ``strength:<value>``,
      ``fraction:null``).
    * ``supports`` edges come from each support leaf's ``supports:`` block
      (``source: sup-id``, ``target: clm-id``, ``relation:"supports"``,
      ``target_kind:"claim"``, ``strength:null``, ``fraction:<f>`` where
      f ∈ [0, 1], OR ``fraction:"*pending*"`` for an unassessed edge). The
      pending-fraction literal is distinct on disk from a depends edge's
      ``fraction:null``. The DERIVATION-branch analog of a ``strengthens`` edge.
    * ``rests-on`` edges come from a claim entry's own depends-on bullets, the
      ones whose target is a ``work-`` id (``source: clm-id``,
      ``target: work-<key>``, ``target_kind:"work"``, ``strength:null``,
      ``fraction`` the pairing's applicability or the pending literal). They
      gate: an applicability above zero puts the work's ``strength`` into the
      source's dependency ``min``, a zero one takes the pairing out of it, and
      either left unsupplied keeps the source pending.
    * ``references`` edges come from a claim entry's ``- references:`` bullets
      (``source`` and ``target`` both ``clm-`` ids, ``target_kind:"claim"``,
      ``strength:null``, ``fraction:null``). They record a cross-reference the
      corpus states and gate nothing: no solidity computation reads them, and
      the acyclicity gate is over ``depends`` alone, two claims naming each
      other being the author's argument rather than circular reasoning.
    * ``demoted`` edges come from a claim entry's ``- demoted:`` bullets: every
      field a ``references`` record carries, then a ninth, ``origin``, which
      only this class's records have.

    Emitted per claim as depends, references, demoted, so the stable sort
    keeps that order between records of one source, target and context.
