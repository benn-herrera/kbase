"""The claim-graph builder's command line: run it from inside the consuming repo.

Nothing is discovered but the root: the repository root is walked up to from the
working directory, and the KB is the directory beside it — the same rule every
other tool in this toolchain resolves a root by, and the reason none of them
takes an override.

**``graph-init`` runs before this**, and this build does not seed. That verb
creates the derived-index directory and installs the runner include line, which
is the mechanism the last stage's refresh and verify targets exist through. A
run finding no spine says so and names the command that installs one, rather
than creating half of it itself.
