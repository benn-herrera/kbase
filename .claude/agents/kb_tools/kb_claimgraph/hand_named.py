"""Claims named by hand: a claim's printed name and number, written with no ``\\ref``.

*follows directly from Lemma 4.6*, *This proves Theorem B* — the mechanical half
of THESIS gap 2. The author named a claim the way a reader would, and the markup
carries no anchor for stage D to read, so the mention is found here off the
words themselves and offered as an **edge candidate**: :func:`attribute.narrow`
merges it with whatever a reference reached on the same pair, and it is
classified and recorded like every other candidate.

**The names are the corpus's own.** The display names of the blocks this corpus
states its results in (:func:`claim_names`) — whatever its ``\\newtheorem``
declarations printed — and never a list of what mathematicians usually call
things. A corpus naming its results *Result* is read for *Result 3* and not for
*Theorem 3*.

**The number is the printed one**: any dotted depth, a single capital for
headline and appendix results, a lowercase sub-item suffix matched and dropped —
*Lemma 4.6a* names Lemma 4.6. A printed list names each of its items: *Lemmas 2
and 3* is two mentions (:data:`tree.LIST_SEPARATOR`).

**A mention is a candidate only where it joins** (:func:`printed_claims`): some
claim-bearing block renders that exact name and number on its display line, or a
claim with no block carries it as its whole title. A mention joining nothing
produces nothing. Where the name and number join claims in several volumes, the
mention's own volume is preferred, a multi-paper KB numbering each paper's
results from one.

**Scanned only within the bodies of the node set**: a claim-bearing block's
extent, and the paragraph a prose claim was minted from. A proof is no node, and
prose no claim was minted from is no node's body. Inside a body three things are
skipped: an anchor, already a ``\\ref`` stage D reads; a citation, so
``\\cite[Theorem 2.4]{…}`` — another work's theorem — never counts; and a
mention its next words hand to a citation, *Theorem 3 of* ``\\cite{…}``, which
names the same other work's theorem from outside the bracket. A block's own
display line is its label, not a mention, and is skipped too: corpora number two
blocks alike often enough that reading it would join each to the other.

**The join reads the number the tree prints, and that is not always the
author's.** The reader numbers theorem-like blocks on a counter of its own, so
a paper numbering *Proposition 1.3* within its section may render that block's
display line *Proposition 17*, and the author's *Proposition 1.3* then joins
nothing.
