"""Stage B — the claim-site inventory. One pass over every document.

Five readings, each keyed on a form the Document-Tree Contract states rather
than on a shape observed once in one corpus:

* **labelled blockquotes** (point 12) — the environment's display name off the
  label line, the identifier where the source carried a ``\\label``, the title
  and locator off the display line beneath, and the block's extent;
* **display-maths fences** (point 9) — so an equation is never mistaken for
  prose and never quoted as a claim, and the ``\\label`` tokens inside them;
* **rewritten cross-references** (point 7) — with the document each resolves to,
  its type, the author's own label off its third attribute, and which labelled
  block it sits inside where it sits inside one. **One record per label, not per
  anchor**: a cleveref command takes a list, so ``\\cref{a,b}`` reaches the
  reader as one element naming two targets and stating two relationships, and it
  is read as two (:func:`tree.anchor_labels`);
* **rendered citations** (point 10) — see the caveat below;
* **which claim each proof establishes** (:class:`Proof`) — the one reading that
  spans documents, and the one that is a *relation between* blocks rather than a
  reading of one.

**The name being classified is the environment's display name.** A
``\\newtheorem`` declares two strings — an arbitrary internal handle and a
display name saying what the block is — and point 12's label line carries the
second, so ``\\newtheorem{claimbox}{Result}`` is classified as a ``Result``.
That is the difference between a vocabulary and a list of handles: across 35
surveyed arXiv papers, 43 distinct internal handles appear and 36 fall outside
any table, because the tail is aliases (``Cor``, ``Lem``, ``Pro``), starred
variants (``lem*``) and other languages (``Teo``, ``oss``) — while the display
names concentrate onto the thirteen words below. Where no declaration supplied
a display name the label carries the handle instead (``proof``, which amsthm
declares and no author does), and that is the same string it always carried.

**Names are classified against a closed table, case-folded, and a name outside
it is recorded rather than refused.** The block is admitted as
not-claim-bearing for that build — :attr:`Block.claim_bearing` reads
:data:`CLAIM_BEARING` alone, so an unclassified name is outside it by
construction — and the name is counted into the census this stage reports
(:func:`census`, ``Census.unclassified``). Case is folded because the label
carries the author's own capitalisation and ``Theorem`` and ``theorem`` are the
same word; the census reports the name as the page spells it.

**What the closed table guards against is silence, not omission.** The argument
that made this a refusal is right and stands: a default column *is* how a claim
silently leaves the graph, and nothing here classifies an unknown name as
claim-bearing. What the refusal conflated was *do not lose claims quietly* with
*stop*, and only the first is load-bearing. A recorded, named, counted omission
is not silent — it is the census line a reader greps — while a halted build
reports one bit and no distribution at all. That distinction is why
:data:`NOT_CLAIM_BEARING` exists at all, independently of anything branching on
it: it is what separates a name somebody classified as not stating a result from
a name nobody has classified, and the census reports only the second. One
consumer now spends that judgement rather than only subtracting it — stage D
contributes no pair for a reference whose fragment names a block any of these
names classifies, ``proof`` excepted (:data:`NOT_A_CLAIM_TARGET`) — and it
reaches classified names alone for the same reason the census reports the
others: a refusal standing on a judgement nobody made is the default column this
module has no column for.

**This is what makes the stage usable outside the corpus it was calibrated on.**
Even over display names the table is a table: the survey's residue is some
fifteen one-offs — ``Setup``, ``Axiom``, ``Case``, ``Fact``, ``Hypothesis``,
``Exercise``, ``Solution`` — and a name outside the table has to cost a census
line rather than a run.

A ``proof`` is not a claim; it is the derivation establishing one. A
``conjecture`` **is** claim-bearing, and that is a ruling rather than a default:
a conjecture is a result the corpus states and does not prove, which is exactly
the condition local rigor grades and solidity propagates, so it belongs in the
graph carrying a low rigor rather than outside it carrying none. A ``claim`` and
a ``result`` are claim-bearing on that same reading. ``definition`` is
classified not-claim-bearing because SPEC.md rules definition nodes out of
scope; ``problem`` states a question rather than a result, and ``example``,
``assumption``, ``notation`` and ``remark`` state no result at all.

**A blockquote with no label line is not an unclassified block.** It is ordinary
quoted prose — an author quoting a conclusion, a displayed italic passage — and
reporting it would be reporting that the author quoted something.

**The optional argument is what point 12 preserves, not what it requires, and
most authors write none.** ``\\begin{lemma}`` untitled is the overwhelming norm
outside corpora written with tooling that prompts for a title, so a stage that
demanded one would refuse most mathematical sources. What such a block's display
line carries is the environment's printed word and its number — ``**Lemma 3**.``
— and that is what is read off it: the title is that span with its emphasis
markers taken off, and the locator is the span. A bare *Lemma 3* is a poorer
heading than an author's own sentence would be, and it is the honest one; point
12's own words are that a consumer reads the author's title there "rather than
inferring one", and where the author gave none there is nothing to read and
still nothing to infer.

**The title carries the words the page shows; the locator carries the page's own
bytes.** They come off one span, so they cannot name different blocks, but they
are not the same string: an author who titled a block ``[\\citet{gibbons2020}]``
titled it with whatever point 10 wrapped that citation in, and a ``<span
class="citation" data-cites="…">`` reaching a register heading is markup where a
reader expects words. The title is therefore that span with the citation markup
replaced by what it renders — the text the page itself shows — while the locator
stays the document's own bytes, because the write API matches it against them.

**A span that runs inside another block's display line is extended through its
own content until it does not.** ``\\newtheorem*`` declares an unnumbered
environment, so a document may carry several blocks whose display line opens
``**Theorem**`` exactly — and the span is a locator a marker is placed by, so
one matching two blocks binds a claim to the wrong site silently. Extending
stays inside what the page carries: the words after the printed name are the
author's, and the first of them that differs is the smallest thing on the page
that tells the two apart. Each such span is grown against the *other lines*
rather than against the spans already handed out, so both of two alike blocks
grow and neither's span depends on which the document lists first. The title
follows the extended span, because a register entry is bound back to its site by
title (``graph.read``) and two entries sharing one would join to one block.

**A display line yielding neither a title nor a locator costs its own block, not
the build.** Two shapes do. One does not open with the environment's printed name
at all: where the declaration sits in a class file rather than in the volume root
the reader has no name and no number to print, so the block's content begins with
the author's own sentence and point 12's span is absent from the line. The other
runs inside another block's display line to its last word, so no span of it names
one block rather than the other. Neither is two mechanical artifacts disagreeing —
it is one authored block this stage cannot read, and a tree it sits in carries
every other document the run derived. So the block is admitted carrying no title
and no locator, :attr:`Block.claim_bearing` is false for it however its
environment is classified, it yields no claim node, and it is counted into the
census (:func:`census`, ``Census.unreadable``). That is the same trade an
unclassified name takes above and it is taken for the same reason: what must never
happen is a claim leaving the graph in silence, and a named count is not silence.

**The maths fence is not anchored at column zero.** Point 9 states both halves:
the opening delimiter is ``` ``` math ``` with a space, and a fence may sit
inside a blockquote prefixed ``> ``. A scanner that assumed column zero would
misread the quoted ones, and the failure is not local — an unclosed fence
swallows everything that follows it.

**A closing delimiter may carry trailing markup, and the contract does not say
so.** Where a quoted fence sits inside an emphasised run, the reader closes the
emphasis on the fence's own line, so the delimiter renders with the emphasis
marker attached to it. That is not a closing fence under CommonMark, and a
reader matching the delimiter exactly finds the fence unclosed and swallows
every claim site after it. The close is therefore matched on the delimiter this
scan opened with rather than on the whole line; point 9 owes a sentence about
the rendered closing form the way it owes one about the opening spelling.

**Every citation carries its own key, and that gap is closed.** A resolved
inline citation used to carry no marker at all — the reader emitted it as
ordinary author-year prose — so this stage could name only the unresolvable ones
and the reference-list entries. The front end's Lua filter now wraps every
citation in pandoc's own citation markup, ``<span class="citation"
data-cites="key1 key2">``, whatever citeproc then does inside it, so the key is
readable off the page in all three of the states a citation can be in: answered
by a bibliography, offered one that did not carry it, and offered none at all.

``Citation.state`` reports which of the three, and it is read off the span's own
rendering rather than off anything about the build. **The span carries both
halves of that comparison**: ``data-cites`` holds the keys, and the span's text
holds what became of them. Text that is exactly its own keys — ``(key1; key2)``,
the form the front end's filter writes where it is told no citeproc will run
(``kb_docgraph/authored_blocks.lua``) — was offered no bibliography. Otherwise
citeproc ran, and a key it could not answer carries ``**key?**`` inside that text
while the rest of the span resolved around it. So the states are **per key, not
per build**: one ``\\citep{a,b}`` renders ``(Nobody 2026; **b?**)`` where the
bibliography answers one of the two.

**"The tree renders no reference list" is not a test for "no bibliography was
offered".** A bibliography that answers none of the cited keys emits no
reference list either, so that reading merges the two states that most need
telling apart — a work fully known and a work nothing is known about. The
span-local comparison above is what avoids it.

**The citation reading is over marker-free text, and that is a scar.** A Tier-2
marker is appended to the end of the line its excerpt begins on
(:func:`tree.strip_markers`), and a claim-bearing block's excerpt begins on its
display line — which is exactly where a theorem environment's optional argument
puts a ``\\cite``. The marker therefore lands *inside* the citation span's
opening tag, between ``class="citation"`` and ``data-cites``,
:data:`CITATION_SPAN_RE` stops matching, and the citation leaves the inventory
with nothing downstream able to tell: there is no second count for it to
disagree with. Measured over the built arXiv corpus, fourteen citations of 2988
vanish this way on a re-scan and **every one of them is a citation inside a
claim block** — fourteen of the twenty-nine there are, because markers and those
citations sit on the same line by construction. So this reading strips markers
the way :func:`_display` already does, and the line numbering survives it: a
marker carries no newline, so :attr:`Citation.line` still addresses the written
document.

**Every reading whose construct can share a line with a marker now strips, and
which those are is decided by what can place one — never by what a corpus
happens to contain.** Two producers put a Tier-2 marker in a tree: a claim
block's own locator, which is :attr:`Block.display`, read off the line two below
the label line; and a prose claim's start line, which
:func:`~kb_tools.kb_claimgraph.identify._opens_a_claim` has already filtered. So
the question each reading answers is whether its construct can occur on a claim
block's display line or on a sentence that predicate admits.

:func:`_anchors`, :func:`_proofs` and :func:`_works` can, and strip. A theorem
environment's optional argument renders its cross-reference on the display
line; a ``proof`` is outside :data:`CLAIM_BEARING` and so outside the
claim-block set that predicate's caller excludes a start inside; and
``references.md`` is a leaf, which puts it inside
:data:`tree.DECLARING_KINDS` like any other. Each function states its own cost
above.

:func:`_fences` and the label-line match opening :func:`_blocks` cannot, and
read raw text deliberately. ``_opens_a_claim`` refuses a start on every line of
``[fence.start, fence.end)`` — ``MathFence.end`` being the closing delimiter's
line plus one, that is the whole of what :func:`_fences` scans — and refuses a
label line under :data:`~kb_tools.kb_claimgraph.identify.MIN_OPENING_WORDS`, a
structural label folding to one or two words. Neither can be reached by a
block's locator either, which sits two lines below the label and, where a
block's content opens with a fence, is never composed at all: the display line
yields no printed-name span, so :attr:`Block.claim_bearing` is false and the
block mints nothing. A strip in either would be a second expression of rules
:mod:`identify` already states.

**The measurement is the confirmation, not the argument, and it is a snapshot.**
Over the arXiv corpus as built — 53 KBs, 2015 documents, 507 marker-carrying
lines, 468 of them on quoted display lines — all five readings return exactly
what they return with markers stripped, and none of the 507 sits on a fence
line, a label line, an anchor, a proof head or a reference entry. What the three
strips are worth is measured by planting one marker where
``kb_write.ops._insert_marker`` puts one, on each construct's own first line:
6449 of 6738 anchors, 61 of 110 proof heads, and marker markup in the rendered
title of 9 of 834 external works. The same plant over the two that do not strip
costs every fence and every block in the corpus, silently — which is what those
two exclusions in :mod:`identify` are holding, and why a change to either is a
change to this module.
