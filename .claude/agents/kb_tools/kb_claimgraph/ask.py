"""This package's asks: what is asked, how it is asked, and the reader that asks it.

**Every claim-graph ask is a letter ask**: one decision, answered with one
letter from a closed set (:mod:`letters`). Three kinds. A **paragraph** ask puts
one paragraph of a leaf to the reader — does it state a result — with the leaf as
:mod:`label` renders it for context; its group is the leaf. A **classify** ask
puts one edge candidate — is the source *supported by* it, *in support of* it,
or does it merely *mention* it — with the source claim and the passages its
references sit in for context; its group is the source claim. An **unmarked**
ask puts one shortlisted pair — does the source claim's text point at the
candidate's result with no cross-reference — with the source's leaf and its
statement for context; its group is the source claim.

**One letter-to-meaning table per kind** (:class:`ParagraphLetter`,
:class:`ClassifyLetter`, :class:`UnmarkedLetter`). A question offering fewer meanings withholds their
letters and never relabels the rest, so a letter means one thing in every ask
of its kind. The letters reach a template only as composer constants
(:data:`LETTER_SLOTS`): a template spelling one would be a second definition of
the string the parse holds the reader to.

**The group's context comes first and the question last.** Every slot of an
item (:data:`ITEM_SLOTS`) sits in a template's final section, after every slot
of its group, so every ask of a group opens with the same bytes and a server
can serve that prefix from cache. A re-ask is the same prompt with a correction
after the question — ``letter-correction``, carrying what came back, cut to
:data:`RETURNED_MAX_CHARS` — so it shares the whole prefix too. No prompt is
written here: each is a template under ``kb_driver/prompt-templates/``, and
this module hands the composer values and the names of the alternatives it
chose.

**The reader is a system prompt and one tool-less chat call.**
:func:`ask_without_tools` is the production :class:`~.letters.LetterReader`:
the :data:`READER_SYSTEM` fragment as the system prompt, through
:func:`kb_tools.inference.call_chat` on the environment's model, so an answer
rests on the prompt and nothing a model chose to look at. Its capture is read
by :func:`kb_tools.inference.read_capture` into :class:`~.letters.CallStats`.
A call that did not reach ``[DONE]`` is re-issued identically up to
:data:`TRANSPORT_ATTEMPTS`, and so is one the server answered without
processing a token; a call that never completes raises :class:`AskError`,
which is the one thing that stops a stage — no answer arrived, and defaulting
every remaining item would hide a dead model behind what looks like a finished
run.
