"""The node pass — stage C-inf, the one home for claimhood in prose.

**The missing middle.** The declared pass authors the claims the author marked;
stage D attributes dependencies over an authored graph. Between them sits the
question neither asks: what does a leaf's prose state. This pipeline asks it of
every leaf, whether or not the leaf hosts blocks, one paragraph at a time: each
paragraph :func:`identify.asked_paragraphs` names is one letter ask, the leaf is
the group whose context those asks share (:func:`letters.ask_group`), and
:func:`identify.judge` turns the letters into verdicts and claims.

**The node-pass record is its scope and its checkpoint** (``kb_pipeline``). The
declared pass lists every leaf ``unread``; this pass reads the unread ones and
completes the ``planned`` ones, and never asks about a leaf the record holds a
plan for. Per leaf, in this order and no other:

1. the leaf's asks, every one answered or defaulted;
2. the leaf's whole outcome — its verdicts, and its claims by title and
   locator — into the record as ``planned``;
3. the KB writes, in one per-leaf act (:func:`write.land_leaf`), which
   completes idempotently from the plan;
4. the leaf marked ``landed``.

So a stop anywhere costs at most one leaf's asks: a resume lands a planned leaf
from its record without asking, and asks only what no plan covers. Only a call
that never completes stops the pass (:class:`~.ask.AskError`); a reply carrying
no offered letter is a default, recorded with its cause.

**It exits on a comparison, never on an opinion.** Every leaf landed, and every
obligated paragraph of every leaf — recomputed over the tree the run just wrote
— carrying a verdict in the record, a defaulted one included. Whether
a paragraph *is* a claim is never checked.

**No number is authored and no edge is.** Every entry's rigor is the pending
literal, and dependency attribution runs afterward from :mod:`depends`.
