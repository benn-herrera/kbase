"""The document tree, read off ``kb-root/`` — this package's sole input.

No ``.tex``, no pandoc AST, no bibliography, no intermediate the front end
happened to keep. Everything the claim graph is built from is read here, and a
fact the tree does not carry is a fact this package does not have.

Three readings live here because more than one stage needs each of them: the
document set with its two link relations (the down-link spine and the up-links
that invert it), the blockquote-prefix strip every scan over an
author-distinguished block runs first, and the marker strip that separates
authored content from the metadata an earlier pass appended to it. Each is read
once and shared, the way :mod:`kb_tools.kb_docgraph.walk` and
:mod:`kb_tools.kb_docgraph.text` are.

#: A rewritten cross-reference, as point 7 renders one. The form it matches is
#: SPEC.md's, under Corpus Invariants' cross-reference join, which is also where
#: the identifier a reference resolves against is stated: this pattern reads a
#: contract rather than being one. All three attributes, in the order the
#: contract states them.
#:
#: **The third is read because an equation reference carries its target nowhere
#: else.** ``data-reference`` is the author's own ``\label``, and it rides every
#: anchor whether or not the fragment does — which for an ``eqref`` is the whole
#: of what says *which* equation, point 9 leaving an equation's label inside the
#: maths fence rather than as an id, so the anchor resolves to its document with
#: an empty fragment. Measured over the staged corpus: 717 of 717 ``eqref``
#: anchors carry no fragment, and 1945 of 1945 anchors carry this attribute.
#:
#: **The type is read as whatever the attribute holds, and a narrower class was
#: the defect.** ``([a-z]+)`` matched ``ref`` and ``eqref`` and refused both
#: spellings pandoc gives the cleveref family — ``ref+label`` for ``\cref`` and
#: ``\autoref``, ``ref+Label`` for ``\Cref`` — so references the trees carried
#: were read as none. SPEC.md's cross-reference join says only that the type is
#: the referencing macro's own kind and enumerates no vocabulary, so a class
#: that enumerates one is a second contract, and the next spelling defeats it
#: the same way this one was defeated.
#:
#: **A cleveref anchor is handed downstream under its own type**, and nothing
#: downstream reads the type to pick a route any more. A cleveref command names
#: whatever its label names and says which nowhere, so calling one an ``eqref``
#: would have asserted about every ``\cref`` to a theorem a thing that is true
#: of few of them, and flattening it to ``ref`` would erase the one fact
#: separating a cleveref equation reference from an author's own ``\ref{eq:8}``
#: — two populations a later pass has to count apart. What the pass-through once
#: cost was that a cleveref naming an equation took the identifier route and
#: reached nothing; :func:`attribute._target_end` now tries the identifier route
#: and falls back to the label-to-fence join for every type alike, so ordering
#: decides what typing used to, and the cost is paid off.

#: across lines and the continuation line carries the quote prefix, which would

#: :data:`ANCHOR_RE` reads the *attributes* and stops at the third, which is all
