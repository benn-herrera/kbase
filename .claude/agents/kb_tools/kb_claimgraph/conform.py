"""Stage A — the conformance gate over SPEC.md's Document-Tree Contract.

**A non-conforming tree does not produce a missing graph, it produces a wrong
one.** So the run opens here, writes nothing, and stops on the first failed
assertion naming the point it belongs to. The check is cheap because the
contract is mechanical, and it is not a defensive parser: it *asserts* the
guarantees rather than tolerating their absence. A tolerant reader would be
building for a contract that does not exist while the one that does went
unenforced.

**The cleanliness check is the declared pass's double-run guard.** That pass
mints ids; a second run over its own output would mint a second set and double
the graph. Point 14 guarantees a fresh tree carries none of the artifacts it
writes, so the presence of any one of them means the input is not a fresh tree,
and :func:`gate` refuses.

**The later invocations' entry condition is a different one.** They extend the
tree additively — SPEC declares nodes additively in leaf frontmatter — so a
whole-tree refusal on "any frontmatter at all" would forbid them entirely.
:func:`pass_two_gate` makes the structural checks alone and partitions the tree
by :func:`determination` for the report. What keeps the node pass from
re-minting is not here: it is the node-pass record's read state.

**The forbidden artifacts are read off the modules that own them** — the
markers' openers off :mod:`kb_tools.kb_write.render` (:data:`tree.MARKER_OPENERS`),
frontmatter by :func:`kb_index_lib.find_frontmatter` — rather than re-typed
here. A cleanliness check carrying its own copy of the spellings would pass a
tree holding an artifact whose spelling had since moved, which is the
silent-clean failure this gate exists to prevent.

**One clause of point 14 is not checked, and that is a ruling rather than an
omission.** Point 14 also forbids a ``.index/`` directory, and what it describes
is what the *front end* leaves behind. Between that front end and this stage
runs ``graph-init``, whose landed behaviour is to create ``.index/`` and install
the runner include line over an already-populated tree (ARCHITECTURE.md,
Initialising the Claim-Graph Spine). Refusing on its presence here would refuse
every run of this stage as designed. Derived space is out of this gate's scope
in both directions: nothing under it is authored, and nothing this stage writes
lands there.
