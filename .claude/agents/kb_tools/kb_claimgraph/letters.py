"""Letter asks: one decision per ask, answered with one letter from a closed set the build offers.

**The stage owns every decision; the reader owns only the call.** A
:class:`LetterReader` takes a :class:`LetterQuestion` — a composed prompt and
the letters it offers — and returns a :class:`Reply`: the text that came back,
and, from a reader that can give one, a probability per label. What the reply
*means* is :func:`decide`'s, the one re-ask and the default are
:func:`ask_group`'s, and the record is this module's. A reader raises
:class:`~.ask.AskError` where its call never completed, and that is the only
thing that stops a group: a reply that carries no offered letter is re-asked
once and then left without one, for the caller to give its stated default.

**What prompts say is not here.** :mod:`ask` composes every kind and hands each
item over as a :class:`LetterItem` whose ``compose`` turns "what came back last
time" (``None`` on a first ask) into the prompt. The re-ask is therefore the
first prompt with a correction after its question, sharing its whole prefix.

**A group shares a prefix, so its first ask runs alone.** The server prefills
and caches the group's context on that call, and the rest run with
:func:`reader_concurrency` asks in flight. Results are kept in item order
whatever order the calls finish in, so concurrency never changes what a caller
writes or the order its record lands in.
