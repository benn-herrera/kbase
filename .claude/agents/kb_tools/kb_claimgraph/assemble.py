"""Stage E — graph assembly. No new fact enters here.

Every value below is read off stage B's inventory or stage C's claims, or is
derived from a path. What this stage adds is arrangement: which register each
entry belongs in, what ``kind:`` each document carries, which documents declare
which claims, and where a Tier-2 marker goes.

**Two kinds of thing are arranged into one kind of entry.** A claim the author
marked as a block, and a referenced equation nothing in the graph holds
(:mod:`equation`) — the second is stage B's reading arranged, exactly like the
first, and both become ordinary ``clm-`` entries. Where they differ is the
marker: an equation has no line of prose to anchor one to, its position being
the ``\\label`` inside its maths fence, so it takes none and is not counted
toward the threshold that demands one of everything else. **The declared pass
arranges only the first.** An equation is minted after the node pass has judged
the prose its references sit in (:mod:`equations`), because a reference in prose
judged not a claim no longer counts, and :func:`equation_entries` is what that
stage arranges them with.

**Ids do not exist yet**, and cannot: an insert op mints its own id and there is
no way to spell "depends on the third entry in this file". So a document record
and a marker record name their claims by **position in** :attr:`Plan.entries`,
which is the order pass 1 mints in and the order the minted ids come back in.
That binding is the whole reason the write path is four passes.

**No number is authored anywhere.** Every register entry's rigor is the pending
literal; there is no confidence, no fraction and no strength in this module or
downstream of it. Local rigor is hand-authored by a grading seat on a later
pass, and solidity is computed by refresh.
