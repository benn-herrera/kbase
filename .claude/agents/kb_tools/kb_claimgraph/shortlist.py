"""The unmarked-reference shortlist: every claim node ranked against every other by what their statements share.

Mechanical, and the draft an ask judges rather than a verdict: a similarity score
is not evidence that one claim's text points at another. For each source the
pool is every other node, less every pair whose unordered form is already an
edge candidate (``attribute.narrow``) — that pair is asked about already.

The ranking is cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors, sublinear term frequency
and smoothed IDF, with the IDF taken over the target statements; ties go to the
lower target id, so the same statements always give the same ranking. A
statement's terms are its words through :func:`kb_write.ops.canonical_form` —
the fold tier 2 searches with, which drops maths — plus the maths symbols of its
inline spans and display fences, so two claims about ``\\lambda_c`` meet on it.
