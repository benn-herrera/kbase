"""The declared pass: the tree in, the claims the author marked authored into it.

Six stages, run in order. Every one of them terminates on a comparison between
two artifacts or on a return code; none exits on an opinion, and none asks
whether the work is good enough.

**Mechanical end to end.** This pass identifies the claims the author marked and
spends no inference. The stages that do — the node pass over every leaf's
prose (:mod:`discover`), the unmarked-reference asks (:mod:`unmarked`) and
dependency attribution (:mod:`depends`) — are
separate entry points over this pass's output, because a failed or improved
inference must not cost the mechanical work that preceded it and must be
re-runnable without rebuilding the tree. Equations are minted by a stage of
their own after the node pass (:mod:`equations`), a reference in prose judged
not a claim no longer counting toward one.

**This pass's output is a lower bound and says so in its report.** The claims it
authors are the ones the corpus marked; the ones it did not look for are named
by count, and a leaf carrying no author-marked block carries a reason saying
exactly that and nothing more. **It writes the node-pass record fresh**, every
declaring leaf unread, which is the node pass's scope, and the classification
and unmarked records empty, so neither stage resumes from asks another build
answered.
