"""The ``references-found`` stage: references made in prose with no cross-reference, found by asking.

THESIS gap 2. A mechanical shortlist (:mod:`shortlist`) is the draft: per
source claim — every node but a minted equation, which has no text of its own
to point from — its :data:`shortlist.K` best-ranked targets over the whole
node set, less every pair already an edge candidate (:func:`attribute.narrow`)
and every equation minted from inside the source's own body
(:func:`equation_sites.own_equations`). No locality bound enters the pool.
Each shortlisted ordered pair is one letter ask — does the source claim's text point at the candidate's result —
grouped by source in ascending id, every ask of a group sharing the source's
leaf and statement. ``A`` is a yes and the only answer that yields anything:
``B`` and a default (no offered letter after one re-ask) are recorded and
yield no candidate. The ask decides existence only; what a yes is — *supported
by*, *in support of* or *mention* — is classification's.

**The unmarked record is the stage's scope and its checkpoint**
(``kb_pipeline``). The shortlist is planned into it before the first ask, and
each source group's letters land in it as the group completes, so a stop
costs at most the group in flight and a resume asks only the planned pairs it
does not hold. An answer is a fact about the text, so a pair answered under an
earlier plan stays in the record and :func:`found` still reads it.

**Its exit is the ledger's comparison** (``kb_pipeline``'s coverage for the
stage): the record's planned shortlist against its outcomes, every planned
pair carrying one. It writes nothing under ``kb-root/``, so no refresh or
verify follows it.
