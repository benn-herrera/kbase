"""On-demand inference for any tooling that wants some: one tool-less chat call.

:mod:`liaison_tools` holds the whole of it — :func:`call_chat`, the
environment check every call runs (:func:`check_environment`), how a call ended
(:class:`Outcome`), and the one reader of the capture a call writes
(:func:`read_capture`). It knows nothing about a KB and parses nothing in the
reply, and it retries nothing: policy of every kind — retry, a re-ask, where a
bound's value comes from — is the caller's. It is tested against a loopback
stub server, so nothing here needs a reachable model.
