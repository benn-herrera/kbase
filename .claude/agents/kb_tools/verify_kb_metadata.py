"""Mechanical integrity check for the knowledge-base claim-quality framework.

Read-only. Never modifies any file. Reads each document's frontmatter through
``kb_index_lib``, the canonical reader of it.

Seventeen checks, all hard fail-loud:

    0. Quality-block integrity: every ``### Quality`` heading in a
       ``claim-quality.md`` register sits within a ``---``-delimited section
       that also carries the claim's ``## <title>`` heading and its
       ``<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`` marker. An orphan ``### Quality`` block is
       a hard failure. (Not refresh-fixable; delete the orphan or restore the
       missing title/id.)
    1. Tier 1 coverage: every leaf declares its content via at least one of
       ``{claims:, no-claim:, experiment-nodes:}`` (hosting an experiment node
       satisfies coverage on its own). ``claims`` and ``no-claim`` stay mutually
       exclusive with each other; ``experiment-nodes`` is orthogonal and may
       co-exist with either.
    2. Tier 2 coverage: every multi-claim leaf has proximal inline markers
       (``<!-- claim-quality: <id> ... -->``) for each ID in its claims list.
    3. ID uniqueness: no canonical ``<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`` appears twice
       in any ``claim-quality.md`` register.
    4. Orphan refs: every Tier 1 ID resolves to a canonical entry.
    5. Frontmatter presence: every non-excluded .md file has a frontmatter
       block. (Not refresh-fixable for any document, index or leaf: refresh
       splices a field into a block that already exists, so a document with
       no block at all needs one written.) A document still carrying a
       ``0.9.0`` comment block is listed with the block named: no current
       reader takes it as frontmatter, and refresh migrates only a KB stamped
       older, never one document. ``--skip-frontmatter-presence``
       excludes this one check, for graph-init's fused verify pass alone —
       see that flag's help text.
    6. Subtree consistency: each ``kind: index`` file's ``subtree-claims``
       equals the union of leaf claims under its directory; entry-point's
       equals the global union. (refresh-fixable.)
    7. Bidirectional coverage: every canonical ``clm-`` entry is back-linked
       by at least one leaf's frontmatter. An external-work entry is the
       stated exception — no leaf hosts a work — and is covered from the
       other direction instead; see :func:`check_uncited_entries`.
    8. No-claim/claims exclusivity: no leaf carries both fields.
    9. Index files well-formed: each ``.index/*.yaml`` stream exists, every
       line is ``--- `` and a JSON object, and the file ends with exactly one
       ``\\n``. Missing files and EOF defects are refresh-fixable; a malformed
       line is not (indicates a bug or merge corruption).
   10. Index freshness: each ``.index/*.yaml`` matches the canonical
       byte-for-byte serialization of the in-memory record set built from
       the canonical KB sources. (refresh-fixable.)
   11. Index referential integrity: every id referenced in depends-on /
       strengthen-by / cites / subtree-aggregates resolves to a record in
       claims.yaml (which holds claim, framework and external-work nodes),
       and every depends-on edge's target_kind matches the resolved node's
       node_type. Per edge class, which of ``strength`` / ``fraction`` must be
       null and which must carry a value in range is checked here too, and a
       ``demoted`` row's ``origin`` must be one of
       ``kb_schema.DEMOTED_ORIGINS``. (Not refresh-fixable; symptom of a build
       bug or a hand edit.)
   12. Solidity-graph acyclicity: the claim depends-on graph must be a DAG.
       A cycle makes solidity undefined for its members. (Not refresh-fixable;
       the cycle must be broken in the claim depends-on declarations.)
   13. Solidity freshness: every claim entry's on-disk ``solidity`` line and
       the depends-on ``(solidity X)`` annotations must equal what
       ``kb_index_lib.compute_solidity`` derives, and the ``.index/claims.yaml``
       solidity fields must match. ``solidity`` is a derived field — drift
       means refresh has not been run. (refresh-fixable.)
   14. Leaf-references freshness: every claim-quality entry's on-disk
       ``> **Leaf references:**`` footer must equal what
       ``kb_index_lib.build_leaf_references`` derives from the reverse-citation
       map (which leaves host the entry's id). The footer is a derived field;
       a hand-edited, stale, or missing footer is drift. (refresh-fixable.)
   15. Register census: in every ``claim-quality.md`` register the count of
       canonical ``<!-- id: -->`` markers equals the count of records the
       production parser returns, per node kind, AND every marker is the first
       line under its own ``## <title>`` heading. A marker that produces no
       record is a lost entry; a marker bound to the *previous* entry's heading
       produces a record under the wrong title and leaves the counts equal.
       (Not refresh-fixable; restore the heading above the marker.)
   16. Support fan-out reconciliation: the ``supports:`` relationship is the one
       edge the schema records at two authored ends — staged in the ``sup-``
       register entry and declared in the hosting leaf's frontmatter. Where a
       register stages a fan-out for a support whose leaf exists, the two ends
       must name the same beneficiaries at the same on-point fractions. (Not
       refresh-fixable; the two authored blocks disagree.)

Every ``demoted`` edge the registers record is reported as one ``[finding]``
line: structure the KB carries, never a failure, so it changes no exit code.

Checks 15 and 16 are taken in ONE walk of the registers, and that walk is
``kb_index_lib.walk_registers`` — which returns what it found as data.
:func:`check_register_walk` here only decides which of those findings are gate
failures, rather than re-implementing a grammar this toolchain defines once.

Future / queued (not implemented):

* A relative-link integrity check — verify that each Markdown
  cross-reference in a leaf resolves to an existing file, and surface dead
  *forward* links (a foundational common/ or vol1 leaf pointing to a
  not-yet-migrated later-volume leaf) as an optional warning rather than a
  hard failure. Such forward links are intentional threads for later
  cross-reference stitching passes; only their dead-ness is worth flagging,
  not their existence.

A KB in an older metadata format is reported stale and nothing else is
checked: ``kb-refresh`` migrates it. A newer one is refused (exit 2).

Failure categories are tagged refresh-fixable or manual-fix. If any
refresh-fixable failures are present, the report ends with a hint to run
the project's refresh target first; verify is read-only and never auto-fixes.

    findings are gate failures — the same split ``check_subtree_consistency``
    and ``check_solidity_cycle`` already keep with their library computations,
    and the reason the claim-graph renderer can ask the same question without
    re-walking the registers behind this module's back.

    The three failure classes, and why each is one:

    * **census** — a canonical marker that produces no record is an entry the
      KB has lost. Enforcing that rule only on the hot path of a write leaves a
      KB nobody is writing into unmeasured, so its markers can outnumber its
      records with every gate green; this gate measures it on every run.
    * **binding** — a marker bound to the WRONG heading leaves
      the counts equal and every title in the file off by one entry, so the
      count alone cannot see it.
    * **fan-out** — where a support's two authored ends are both live, they are
      double bookkeeping and must agree. A register that stages nothing is not
      participating (staging is optional, and a fan-out authored only in its
      leaf is the ordinary case), and staged pairs with no hosting leaf yet are
      the documented pre-leaf stage — neither is a defect, and
      :attr:`kb_index_lib.FanOutRecord.double_entered` is what says so.

    None of the three is refresh-fixable: all three are authored layout or
