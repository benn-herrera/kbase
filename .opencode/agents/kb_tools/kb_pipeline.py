"""The KB build pipeline's state machine: stage table, ledger, checklist.

**The stage table lives here and only here.** The ordered stage vocabulary is
the in-code constant :data:`STAGES`; agent definitions read it out of
``kb_util show-status`` rather than enumerating stages of their own, so there
is exactly one source and no definition can drift from it.

**The ledger is the git commit trail.** There is no pipeline metadata file:
the KB and the repository's history are the only durable state. A stage
boundary is recorded by making a commit whose subject carries the stage id,
and status is read back with ``git log --grep``.

Subject format — stable, greppable, and machine-readable::

    kb-build: <stage-id> | <display name>

``<stage-id>`` is the first whitespace-free token after the ``kb-build: ``
prefix. It is one of :data:`STAGE_IDS` or a retired id, which
:func:`recorded_stages` reads as no stage at all. The body follows the
subject: a note paragraph — the charter path on ``start``, the ``--note`` text
``advance-step`` carries on any stage — then the build's inputs, one line per
path (:class:`BuildInputs`), each part omitted where it is empty.

**Stage-addressed and declarative.** Recording is idempotent per stage — a
re-record reports and exits 0 — and out-of-order recording is refused with
the checklist, so a caller with a wrong world-model is corrected rather than
obeyed.

Stdlib only.

    :func:`claimgraph_stage` resolves — so a build cannot invoke a pass the
    tool would run as a different stage.

    ``display`` is what the stage is *for*, in the reader's words, and it is the
    whole of what this table says about purpose. It reaches a reader three ways
    and no other: the checklist line, :func:`stage_status`' ``FACT`` line, and
    the boundary commit's subject.

    ``coverage`` reports the units the stage must cover and which of them are
    satisfied. Every stage has one: a stage with no enumerable decomposition
    returns a degenerate report of one unit rather than no report at all, which
    is how a stage that gates on nothing says so instead of being silent.

    ``work_is_inference`` marks a stage whose work is a model call — the stages
    a build spending none does without. It is the *other* half of what excuses
    a coverage unit, and both halves are needed: a build that spent no
    inference still derived its tree and seeded its spine for real, so those
    stages' own-work units stand. Only where this stage's work was the
    inference and the unit asserts that work is there nothing left to assert
    (:func:`_excused`).

    ``claimgraph_invocation`` is set on the five stages ``kb_claimgraph`` runs
    and on no other — the mapping between this vocabulary and that tool's
    command line, read from both ends.

    ``mints_nodes`` marks a stage that may add a node to the claim graph. The
    stages that do form one contiguous run, and ``kb_index_lib.scan_authored_ids``
    keeps the same keys across every stage after it: the node set is fixed
    before any edge is drawn over it.

# The frozen vocabulary. Ids are a cross-team contract — templates elsewhere

# place; a change means a new id and a migration.
#
# A retired id is never reused. Built ledgers still record `phase-5`, the
# document audit that followed `overview-drafted`, and `recorded_stages` reads
# an id outside this table as no stage at all — which is what keeps such a
# ledger complete, and what a new stage spelled `phase-5` would silently
# inherit as already recorded.

# **A stage is as small as the most expensive thing in it that must not be
# repeated** (SPEC.md, The Driver's Contract). A boundary is a stage, so a stage
# holding two steps that spend inference would leave the first one's result
# behind a step that can fail, and a resume re-spends what had already been
# earned. That is what puts `overview-drafted`'s boundary immediately behind
# its draft's model call, and it is also what retired the alternative, which
# was to trust the draft's scratch file on re-entry: an output no boundary
# accounts for is discarded, and a boundary immediately behind the draft means
# there is nothing left to trust.
#
# The rule is enforced over the step table rather than restated here
# (`kb_driver.steps`, and `test_kb_driver_steps.py`'s assertion that no failable
# row stands between an inference-spending row and its boundary). A stage that
