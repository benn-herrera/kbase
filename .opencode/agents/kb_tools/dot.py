"""The one module that knows how a graph is drawn.

Everything the package draws goes through :func:`to_svg`, and nothing else in
it names the ``dot`` binary or builds an argv for it, so replacing the layout
engine is one module's rewrite. ``tests/test_binary_monopoly.py`` is what says
the monopoly still holds on each run.

The binary is Graphviz's, assumed present on the system. This module neither
installs nor vendors it, and an absent one is :exc:`DotMissingError` naming what
to do — never the ``FileNotFoundError`` subprocess would otherwise raise.

``dot -V`` on the dev host, verbatim (it writes to stderr, not stdout)::

    dot - graphviz version 16.1.0 (20260904.0139)

Stdlib only.
