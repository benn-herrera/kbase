"""Stage 2 — the AST is the index, the Markdown is the content.

The stage zips two sequences produced by the same source: the AST's ``Header``
elements give an ordered list of levels and labels, and the rendered Markdown,
split on its headings in document order, gives each node its body. Level and
label come from the first; text comes from the second. **No node's content is
re-rendered from an AST slice.**

The reason is not economy. A whole-document render computes theorem numbering,
citation rendering and the bibliography once, *across* the document; rendering N
slices independently invites each to be numbered in its own universe, and the
defect would be a plausible-looking *Theorem 1* in every leaf.

The AST is needed for exactly one thing the Markdown cannot supply: **heading
labels**. A Div's identifier survives into gfm as literal HTML, but a heading
renders as ``# Text`` with nowhere to put one, so a section's ``\\label`` exists
only in the AST.

**One block is lifted out of the content stream before the split, and it is not
an elision.** Citeproc appends the bibliography at the end of the rendering,
where a split at headings would leave it inside whatever section the source
happened to end with — a placement that is incidental and that moves the day an
author adds a section. It is cut out here and becomes ``<volume>/references.md``,
a leaf under the volume index. The words are relocated, not dropped, so the
partition still accounts for every one of them.

**A document that has children carries no source of its own.** The prose a
section owns ahead of its first subsection, and the volume's abstract and
lead-in ahead of its first heading, are source like any other extent — so they
become a leaf of that node rather than staying in a container. An index that
holds source is a document a reader has to open to find out whether it is a
signpost or an argument, and every consumer downstream then has to ask the same
question of every index it walks. What a container keeps is its own heading,
its up-link, its child list, and whatever summary a later stage writes below
them.

**The heading stays; only the prose beneath it moves.** A container's heading is
what names it to a reader who opened it, and nothing downstream puts one back —
so a container that gave its heading away would be a document with no title for
good, and the tree would hold two shapes of index depending on whether a section
happened to write a lead-in. The leaf gets a supplied heading of its own, the
way the reference list does.

That supplied heading is why :func:`_supplied_titles` counts one per lifted
leaf. **The rule there is that the accounting balances**: a title this stage
supplies is listed exactly as many times as a segment carries it, which is what
keeps the lift a relocation rather than a word the split invented.

**The two sequences are asserted aligned before either is used** — equal count,
matching levels, matching titles, in order. They are the same headings from the
same source, so a misalignment means a filter added or dropped one, and it fails
loudly rather than shifting every label silently onto the wrong node.
