"""Reading pandoc's JSON AST — the index the Markdown is split against.

The AST is word-granular: every word is a ``Str``, every gap a ``Space``. There
is no phrase in it to match, so everything here walks. A grep for a phrase over
the JSON returns zero and means nothing.

What this module reads off a document, and why each is needed:

* **the ``Header`` sequence** — the levels and the labels the gfm writer throws
  away. A heading renders as ``# Text`` with nowhere to put an identifier, so a
  section's ``\\label`` exists only here.
* **the identifiers a ``Div`` or a ``Figure`` carries**, and the ``\\label``
  inside display-maths source. Together with the headers these are every
  cross-reference target a volume declares.
* **the text runs of every leaf block, and of ``meta``** — what the partition
  check compares against the rendering.
* **the maths**, counted and carried, for point 9's claim.

``meta`` is walked **recursively and by node type**, never enumerated by
container: ``author`` is a ``MetaList`` of ``MetaInlines``, and a walk that
handles ``MetaBlocks`` and ``MetaInlines`` alone skips it without a word.

**A heading inside a blockquote is that blockquote's content and not a heading
of the document.** Point 12's author-distinguished block reaches this walk as a
``BlockQuote`` — the filter has already reshaped it — and an author who wrote
``\\paragraph{Step 1.}`` inside a proof wrote a step of that proof, not a
section of the volume. The rendering side agrees by the same rule: a quoted
heading line opens with ``>`` and :func:`text.headings` leaves it where it
sits, so the two sequences stage 2 zips are the same sequence rather than two
that happen to match. Reading it the other way would split the tree at *Step
1*, hang half a proof off the outline, and break point 12's rendered form for
the block it tore.
