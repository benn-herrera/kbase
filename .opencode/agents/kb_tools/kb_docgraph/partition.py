"""The build's own checks: is the tree a partition of the source, and did the maths survive.

**Two checks, because there are two things that can lose content.** Check A
compares the AST and ``meta`` against the whole-volume rendering and catches what
*pandoc* drops; check B compares that rendering against the tree and catches what
*this stage's splitter* drops. Neither substitutes for the other: pandoc's losses
are invisible to a check that starts from its output, and a splitter's losses are
invisible to a check that never opens the tree.

**Check A matches by contiguous run, not by set membership.** It crosses a format
boundary, so exact bytes are unavailable — but an abstract restates the body, and
a score over shared tokens rates a dropped abstract as present. A run of words in
the same order is what the two documents do not share by accident.

**Check B is a near-total partition**, Markdown on both sides. Navigation text is
exempt by construction rather than by rule: a document's body and its up-link and
child list are different fields, and only the body is compared, so a heading
reaching both its own document and its parent's child list is not duplication.
The comparison runs in both directions — the volume's words against the segments
the splitter cut, and each segment's words against the body that segment became —
so neither a drop in the cut nor a drop in a per-document transform passes.

**The elision list is closed: presentation apparatus, and nothing else.** It is
:data:`outline.APPARATUS_KEYS` plus the ``titlepage`` Div the filter drops, both
literals a diff can show. Widening it is a plan change, not a code change. This
is what makes the maths, citation and figure claims enforceable rather than
aspirational — pandoc is known to lose content silently, including in two ways
nobody had named until a walk went looking.
