"""Citation-grammar gate for a KB's authored files.

A claim may be referenced only through a sanctioned CHANNEL, and an authority
may be cited only in a sanctioned FORM. Prose that names a claim or an
invariant in passing is neither: it reads as authority while carrying none,
which is how a wrong rule rationalizes itself into a corpus.

Sanctioned reference channels (a claim/experiment/support id may appear here):

  - leaf frontmatter fields (``claims:``, ``depends-on:``, ``exp-id:``, ...)
  - sidecar structured fields — a register entry's ``- <field>:`` bullets
  - Tier-2 markers — ``<!-- claim-quality: <id> ... -->``
  - a markdown link whose target is a KB path

Sanctioned authority-citation form:

    ["<excerpt>"](<kb-relative-path>#<anchor>)

the link text carrying the minimal quoted excerpt and the target a durable KB
path plus anchor.

Five checks, all errors:

  1. channel exclusivity — citation-shaped prose outside the sanctioned forms
  2. referent existence  — every citation link resolves
  3. excerpt match       — the quoted excerpt appears at the target's section,
                           whitespace-normalized, and is bounded to one clause
  4. durable target      — targets live inside kb-root, never scratch or
                           outside the repo
  5. edge-backed foreign reference — a foreign-domain id in a register entry
                           needs a matching depends-on edge, or an entry-level
                           ``no-edge: <reason>`` exemption

SCOPE — authored files only. Leaf BODIES are exempt: a leaf body is converted
corpus prose, so an id or an invariant name standing in it is the source's own
word and not a citation this KB makes, while the leaf's own claim-graph
obligations live in its frontmatter and markers, which ARE in scope. The
exemption keys on the declared ``kind:`` and never on what a body looks like.
Registers, indexes, summaries,
``invariants.md`` and the meta-docs are scanned whole. ``.index/`` is out of
scope entirely — it is contract and derived space, not build-authored content
(the exclusion comes free from ``kb_links.SKIP_DIRS``).

Every check is code-fence aware: an example inside a fence is documentation,
not a citation.

Stdlib only.
