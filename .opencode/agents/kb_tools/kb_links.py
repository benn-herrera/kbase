"""Shared Markdown link-scanning primitives for the KB toolchain.

Single source for the low-level Markdown scanning the repo does in more than
one place: neutralizing code spans, the inline-link regex, target cleanup, and
the file crawl. Both the KB link checker (``verify_md_links.py``) and
the query CLI's on-demand reverse-find (``kb_cmd``) import these so there is
exactly one copy of each primitive.

Also the one rewrite of a link: ``rebase_inline_links``, for text copied from
one document into a document in another directory.

This is the *primitive* layer only. Link classification and gating (which
links are broken, which gate the exit code) stay in ``verify_md_links.py`` —
that logic is verifier-specific and not shared.

Stdlib only.

    The one fence scanner for the toolchain: the register parser, the link
    checker, the citation gate and the metadata verifier all reach this
    function, so a fence means the same thing to each of them. Divergent
    scanners are how ``refresh`` comes to corrupt an example that ``verify``
    reports missing.

    A fence opens on a run of three or more `` ` `` or ``~``, at any indentation
    and under any depth of blockquote marker. It closes on a run of the SAME
    character, at least as long, carrying nothing after it but emphasis markers.
    Every one of those conditions is a measured failure:

    * length — a ```` ```` ```` block quoting a ``` ``` ``` line closed on the
      inner run and re-opened on the outer, inverting inside-ness for the whole
      rest of the file;
    * indentation — a closing fence indented under a list item did not match a
      column-0-anchored opener at all, desyncing the toggle so that an entire
      claim register scrubbed to nothing and parsed as zero entries;
    * the blockquote prefix — a display-maths fence inside a labelled blockquote
      never opened, so its LaTeX was scanned as prose and its subscript brackets
      were reported as broken links;
    * the emphasis tail — that same fence, sitting inside an emphasised theorem
      statement, closes on ``` ```* ```, and a reader that refused it swallowed
      every line after it.

    **A fence opened inside a blockquote closes with the blockquote.** Fenced
    content takes no lazy continuation, so a line carrying no marker is outside
    the quote and outside the fence — which is the bound that keeps an unclosed
    quoted fence from blanking the rest of a file and reporting the silence as
    a clean scan.
