"""Relay batons — one per exit code, plus the unlisted-code fallback.

Every terminating invocation of the driver ends by printing a baton: the card
that tells the relaying session what to place in its message body, what to ask
the user, and what to run next. The exit-code vocabulary and the ASK / THEN RUN
content both live here and only here, so a config error at load time and a
completed build print their cards through the same call — the relay reads a
card, it never remembers a protocol.

The fallback is the load-bearing row: an unrecognized exit state is the one
place a session will otherwise improvise, and improvisation there is how a
stopped build gets narrated as a working one.

It is also the sole renderer of the **barrier record** — the file in the
run directory that is not a source a session summarizes but the message body it
pastes. ``barriers.py`` constructs the :class:`BarrierRecord`; this module emits
its bytes, exactly as ``BatonContext`` is constructed elsewhere and rendered
here. The record body and the baton are printed as two calls and stored as one
file, so the bytes at stdout and the bytes on disk cannot diverge.

Stateless leaf: no state, no I/O of its own, and no import of another driver
module. This module renders text; the caller prints it (through
``runlog.relay``). Which command a resume line names — the runner's target or
the driver's own line — is ``kb_util.build_cmd``'s answer, read off the
repository the card is rendered in.

# gets its question card back with no edit here.
