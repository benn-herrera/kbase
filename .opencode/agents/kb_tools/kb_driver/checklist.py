"""The one parse of ``show-status``'s checklist block, and of a console it was relayed into.

``kb_pipeline`` writes the block (``checklist_lines``); the driver reads the
render back across a process boundary, through the ``kb_util show-status``
subprocess adapter (``ledger.show_status``). So the format travels as text and
is parsed here, once — a second regex over the same render is how two readings
of one format start to disagree.

The driver relays every status render it gets, and its relay card, to its
stdout, so a detached build's console log carries both: :func:`read_console`
lifts the newest whole status card and the relay card back out of it, with the
span of console text between them, for ``kb_util await-build``.

Stdlib only.
