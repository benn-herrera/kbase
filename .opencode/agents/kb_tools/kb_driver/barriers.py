"""The typed barrier registry, answer resolution, and the record's construction.

A barrier is an **exit, never a prompt**: the driver never reads stdin from
a human and never blocks on one. A raise persists a record, prints the render
and its baton, and ends the process. The answer arrives on the *next*
invocation, through one of two doors with one vocabulary — the
``[barriers.<stage>.<kind>]`` config tables and the repeatable
``--decide <stage>.<kind>=<answer>[:<free text>]``.

What lives here:

* **The registry** — one :class:`BarrierSpec` per ``(stage, kind)``, carrying
  the admissible answers, the exit code that holds when the barrier is not
  resolved, and the question text the record renders verbatim. Every admissible
  answer continues the run; a barrier stops it by going unanswered, which is the
  only way it stops. Raise sites reference registry members, never string
  literals; :data:`REGISTRY` is the authority. **No wildcards** — a wildcard
  reintroduces the prose topic-matching the typed registry exists to kill.
* **Resolution** — :class:`Resolver`, which applies ``--decide``'s precedence
  over config, consumes each answer at most once per run (a second raise of the
  same pair is an automatic stop even if config answers it), and reports the
  ``--decide`` values whose pair was never raised.
* **The record's construction** — :func:`record` builds the
  :class:`baton.BarrierRecord`. ``baton.py`` renders it; the split is
  deliberate, and it is the same one ``BatonContext`` already has.

What does not live here: raising decisions of its own. Whether a scope line is
an expansion, whether a cap is spent, whether a gate was reached — those are
the run loop's readings of formats it parsed. This module only says what a
barrier is, what answers it takes, and what happened to the one supplied.

**Reachability, whole.** Every registered pair must have a raise site in
``steps.py``. The registry below carries every pair, the step
table holds rows for every stage, and every one of those pairs is raised by
one of them — so the unit tests assert both directions over the **whole**
registry rather than over a cut: no raise site names an unregistered pair, and
no registered pair is an escalation class nothing can reach.

Stdlib only.
