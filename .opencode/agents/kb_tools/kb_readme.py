"""The KB's overview document: the packaged template, filled once by the build.

``<kb-root>/README.md`` is written at ``overview-drafted`` and nothing re-renders
it, so it states only what stays true as the KB is edited. Every count and the
document listing are left to the commands the template names; what is filled
here is the project's name, the ``*pending*`` literal, and the passage saying
what this corpus is and where a reader starts — written by a model from the
excerpts :func:`compose_excerpts` takes out of the tree, and arriving as one
more entry in the same mapping.

**A slot the caller has no value for is a refusal, never a blank.** The template
and the value set are written by different hands; the one failure that must not
be silent is a KB shipping a README with ``{project-name}`` in it, so
:func:`fill` names every unfilled slot and writes nothing.

**The excerpts are a fixed list, in a fixed order, under two caps.** The entry
point, then for each document it lists, that document's index and then its own
opening prose where it has one — the child its index links as
``outline.OWN_PROSE_TITLE``. Nothing else in the tree is read, so the size
follows the number of volumes rather than the size of the corpus. Each body
loses its metadata block and its up-link, and each Markdown link is reduced to
its text, so no path reaches the prompt; any other markup stands. A body over
:data:`EXCERPT_DOCUMENT_CHARS`, or one that would take the whole past
:data:`EXCERPTS_TOTAL_CHARS`, is cut at a paragraph boundary and the cut is
returned for the caller to report. This module must not import
``kb_claimgraph``, whose tree reader would otherwise serve: ``kb_claimgraph``
imports ``kb_driver``, which imports this module.

Stdlib only.
