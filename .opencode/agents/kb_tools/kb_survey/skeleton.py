"""The KB skeleton, derived from the survey manifest — mechanically, down to the leaves.

The document's own segmentation decides the tree. A manifest section is a node;
a section holding no subsections is a **leaf**, a section holding subsections is
an **index** that still carries its own material, and the hierarchy between them
is ``parent_id``'s. Nothing here judges what it finds and nothing here is
authored: the same manifest yields the same tree, byte for byte, so a skeleton is
re-derived rather than persisted and read back.

**Every section is placed exactly once, and every placed node names the source it
came from.** That is a property of the walk below rather than a rule someone
follows, and :func:`partition_defects` is the audit — a derivation compared
against its own input, which is why it costs one pass over ``sections[]`` and no
document has to be opened. A defect here is a fault in this module, never a
finding about a corpus.

**The shape of the tree.**

* ``entry-point.md`` is the root, and belongs to no volume.
* Each entry file owns one **domain**: a directory named by
  :func:`kb_tools.kb_survey.manifest.volume_slug`, with its own ``index.md``. A source
  file two entry files reach is composed once per entry and so yields one
  section record per entry (``manifest.py``, ``sections[].entry_file``); each
  copy is placed under its own volume, which is the coverage-correct answer
  rather than a duplicate.
* A volume's synthetic document root — the record owning front matter, ``level``
  ``document`` — **is** that volume's ``index.md``. Where a volume has none, the
  volume index is a node bound to no section: a directory needs a node whether or
  not the source put material before its first sectioning command.
* Every other section is a document under its parent's directory: a terminal
  section at ``<parent>/<slug>.md``, a subdivided one at
  ``<parent>/<slug>/index.md``.

**An index node carries a section too.** A subdivided section's own extent is the
material between its heading and its first subsection — the lead-in a reader
meets first — and it belongs in that section's index document rather than
nowhere. This is what lets the partition be a bijection from ``sections[]`` onto
the nodes that name one, instead of quietly dropping every interior section's
prose.

**Path segments are slugged from titles, not from ids.** A manifest id is
deliberately unstable across source edits (``manifest.py``, Identity) — inserting
a section renumbers its siblings — and a KB path is durable. A title survives
what an ordinal does not. Collisions inside one directory, empty slugs and names
the indexer excludes are resolved by :func:`_distinct`, so no *section* can land
at a path leaf discovery would not see. A volume directory is deliberately not
disambiguated the same way — the name is the operator's, and `p1.exclude-fit`
surfaces an excluded one instead of this renaming it behind them.

Stdlib only. This module reads no LaTeX, opens no file, and imports no driver.
