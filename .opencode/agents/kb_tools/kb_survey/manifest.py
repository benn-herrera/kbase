"""The survey manifest: record types, the closed flag vocabulary, one writer and one reader.

This module is the manifest schema's only definition. The survey op writes
through :func:`write_manifest`; every consumer — the validator, the driver, the
tests — reads through :func:`read_manifest` and never re-parses the JSON with code
of its own. Both directions are derived from the dataclasses below rather than
hand-written, so a field added to a record cannot be silently missing from either
half.

It holds no LaTeX knowledge and no filesystem policy beyond the atomic write, and
it never imports the parser library. Where a boundary check is possible it is
here, at the write: an absolute path or an id without the ``mf:`` prefix is refused
rather than persisted, because both are guarantees no downstream reader can restore.

**Determinism.** :func:`to_json` sorts keys, emits no timestamp, and records
every path relative to an anchor the manifest itself names — the source root, or
the manifest's own directory (Two path spaces, below) — never absolute and never
derived from the working directory, so the same source tree and flag vector produce
byte-identical output. List order is document order — meaningful, and never the
product of iterating a set or a dict built by discovery order.

**Nothing rendered is stored.** The rendered section index
(:func:`render_section_index`) is a join produced at the point of use. It is not
written beside the manifest, and ``worklist[]`` holds no copy of the section
fields it joins — it is an index into ``sections[]``, not a second view of it.

**Every line-oriented rendering emits exactly one line per record, and asserts it.**
Text a rendering places on a line is whitespace-normalized as it is
placed (:func:`_one_line`) and the count is checked against the records rendered
(:func:`_joined`); the *record* keeps the raw fact. The rendering is model-facing,
so a line count that can drift is a model-facing artifact that can silently
misalign.

**Identity.** ``sections[].id`` is a dotted-ordinal path plus a title slug,
collision-suffixed, and ``results[].id`` is minted the same way. Both carry the
constant ``mf:`` prefix — ``mf:2.3.1-navier-stokes``, ``mf:thm-4.2``. Manifest ids
are stable within a run and across re-runs of the same source, and deliberately not
stable across source edits: inserting a section renumbers its siblings. The prefix
is constant rather than run-derived precisely so the id text does not vary run to
run, and so misuse is checkable by a literal token grep. Where a durable key
exists it is the source's own ``\\label``, which ``results[].label`` carries
unchanged; ``results[].id`` is the sharper hazard of the two, because it sits in the
same record as that durable label and only the prefix says which one survives.
This module mints no claim-graph id and validates none — that space is
``kb_schema``'s.

**Schema notes** — the sentences the field names cannot carry alone:

* ``composed_span`` is an extent in the composed stream and never a place to read
  from — a locator is ``origin`` or ``source_span``.
* ``resolved_result_id: null`` is the ordinary case for a bibliographic ``cite``
  and never means malformed.
* The ``subdivision`` value restates ``subsection_count == 0`` and carries no
  judgment.
* ``mf:`` ids are per-run and never enter ``kb-root/``.
* ``parent_id`` is null at the tree root.
* ``files[].included_by`` is null for an entry file.
* ``files[]`` records **every inclusion occurrence**, so several records may name
  one ``path`` — each with its own ``included_by`` and ``include_origin``.
  A target is composed once per run: its text sits in the stream at the
  **first** inclusion in document order, so the sections it mints attach to the
  parent in force *there* — parent attachment is first-inclusion-wins. Every later
  occurrence is a record plus one ``include-collapsed`` flag and contributes no
  second copy of the lines, which is what keeps two leaves from transcribing one
  stretch of source. A reader counting distinct source files therefore takes
  ``{record.path for record in files}`` and never ``len(files)``.
* ``sections[].entry_file`` names the entry file whose composed stream produced the
  record. A source file two entries reach is composed once per entry, so it yields
  one section record per entry — same title, different ``id``, different
  ``entry_file`` — and that is the coverage-correct answer rather than a duplicate.
  The field is stamped where the entry and its harvest are paired, because it is not
  recoverable afterwards: ``files[].included_by`` is an inclusion edge and reaching
  an entry through it would mean reproducing composition order.
* ``stripped_chars`` is a character count and not a token estimate — a reader
  comparing it against a token-stated criterion applies a rough conversion at the
  point of reading, and no document is restated to match the unit.
* a ``protected_spans[]`` entry says its region must not be *parsed*; it says
  nothing about whether the region counts. It counts — opacity is about parsing,
  never about accounting.
* ``display_math_count`` counts display math **however spelled** — declared
  environments, ``\\[…\\]`` and ``$$…$$`` alike — because the number exists to
  inform a reading seat, and one that reports ``0`` on a section built entirely
  from ``\\[…\\]`` misinforms it. Inline ``$…$`` is not display math and is
  not counted.
* an edge's ``kind`` is the semantic class (``cite`` or ``ref``) and its ``macro``
  is the spelling that produced it: ``\\citep`` and ``\\citealp`` are one relation
  differently written, so a consumer building the origination→citers map groups on
  ``kind`` and reads ``macro`` only for forensics.

**Two path spaces, split by record type rather than by value.** ``files[]`` is the
include DAG and every path in it — ``path``, ``included_by``,
``include_origin.file`` — is source-root-relative, as is ``run.entry_files``. Every
*locator* — ``origin_runs[].file``, ``results[].origin.file``,
``edges[].from_origin.file`` — names an **expanded stream** instead, at the path
:func:`expanded_stream_relpath` gives it, relative to the manifest's own directory:
the survey resolves the document's ``\\newcommand`` macros before it harvests, so the
bytes an extent stands for are the expanded ones and there is no line in an original
``.tex`` that carries them. ``flags[].source_span.file`` is the one field spanning
both, and unavoidably: a flag raised while composing — a missing ``\\input``, a
cycle, an encoding fallback — concerns a source file at a source line, and the
material it names may never have reached the stream at all, so it has no expanded
position to be given.

``origin_runs[]`` is an ordered list of contiguous line runs in the expanded stream
the record's entry file produced. It is the only coordinate space that may appear in
a coverage token, a brief, or any rendered slice. ``level`` is the sectioning command name without its
backslash (``part``, ``chapter``, ``section``, ``subsection``, ``subsubsection``,
``paragraph``, ``subparagraph``, plus ``document`` on the synthetic root); depth is
derivable from the ``parent_id`` chain, the command name is not.

**The preamble is not accounted.** Stream start through
``\\begin{document}`` is parsed for vocabulary and macro definitions, and its lines
appear in no ``origin_runs`` and in no ``stripped_chars``: ``\\usepackage{amsmath}``
is markup, and accounting it would oblige a distiller to transcribe it into a leaf.
Front matter — ``\\begin{document}`` through the first sectioning command — *is*
accounted, and the synthetic root is what owns it.
