"""Stage C — claim identification, split by whether the author marked the site.

**C-mech — block-hosted claims. Mechanical, with no inference at all.** For each
claim-bearing block stage B found, everything a register entry needs is already
on the page: the **title** is the display line's optional argument where the
author wrote one and the environment's own printed word and number where they
did not, the **locator** is the span carrying it, and the **host** is the file.
The first two come off the same span, which is why it is worth naming — a
block's title and the anchor that locates it cannot disagree, so the affordance
does not reduce inference here, it eliminates it.

**C-inf — the node pass over every leaf's readable prose, one paragraph at a
time.** The paragraphs asked about (:func:`asked_paragraphs`) are every
obligated paragraph, whatever its words, and every other paragraph of readable
prose (:mod:`prose`) holding a sentence that could open a claim
(:func:`_opens_a_claim`) — so markup and two-word labels are not asked. Each is
put as one letter ask (:mod:`ask`, :mod:`letters`); this module turns what came
back into verdicts and claims (:func:`judge`) and asks nothing itself.

**A yes mints one claim, and its span is its whole paragraph.** Its title is
derived, not generated: the paragraph's first sentence that could open a claim
(its first sentence where none could), as the page shows it
(:func:`~.inventory.page_text`), on one line, cut at a word boundary within
:data:`TITLE_MAX_CHARS`, and suffixed with the paragraph's position where the
leaf already carries that title. It is therefore the author's bytes, the same on
every run, and unique in its leaf — which is what ``write.land_leaf`` resumes by
and what a register entry is joined back to its site by.

**Every asked paragraph ends with exactly one verdict**: a claim, not a claim,
or defaulted with its cause — no offered letter after the one re-ask, or a yes
whose paragraph the write path cannot place. A default never stops the stage:
a defaulted paragraph is unjudged (:func:`prose.standing`), so its references
keep the rules for prose no reading reached, and the claim it might have been is
the paragraph's cost and nobody else's.

**Placement is the one check, and it is a comparison against the document**
(:func:`_placed`): the paragraph's slice must appear exactly once under the
op's own matching. Whether a paragraph *is* a claim is never checked.
