"""The sentence-labelled render of one document, and the map from a label back to it.

**What the seat is shown, and how a paragraph is named.** Discovery's paragraph
ask shows a model one document rendered one sentence per line, each line opening
with its own label, and asks of one paragraph at a time whether it states a
result. A paragraph is named by its label range (:meth:`Render.span_of`), and the
same span is the slice a yes places (:attr:`Span.excerpt`). So the model answers
with a letter, and every byte written comes from the document.

**Three properties the render has, and each is load-bearing.**

* **One sentence per line, wraps collapsed.** Every line of the render is one
  line of the answer's vocabulary, so a range names a run of sentences rather
  than a run of the wrapping a converter happened to choose.
* **Paragraph breaks are kept, and they are the same breaks the write API sees.**
  ``ops.excerpt_lines`` joins each body line's collapsed text with single
  spaces, so a blank line puts two spaces into its haystack and **no slice can
  cross one**. A paragraph here is therefore exactly a run of lines a slice can
  span, and the rule that a locator lies within one paragraph is what keeps the
  slice findable rather than a matter of taste about locators.
* **Navigation carries no label.** The up-link and the frontmatter block are
  shown as they stand. What the render never offers, a locator cannot name, so
  the exclusion needs no check downstream.

**A display-maths fence is not special here, and measurement is why.** Over the
survey corpus, 74 fences carry 6 blank lines before them: pandoc emits a fence
flush against the prose it interrupts, and 59 of the 74 open mid-sentence. So a
fence sits inside its own paragraph by the ordinary rule, a span crossing one is
findable by the ordinary rule, and the one thing left to say about fences —
*a span may contain an equation and may not be one* — is a comparison against
the fence extents rather than a rule in this render. What the render does do is
leave a fence's lines unsegmented: a sentence splitter run over
``\\begin{align}`` is splitting on the wrong grammar.
