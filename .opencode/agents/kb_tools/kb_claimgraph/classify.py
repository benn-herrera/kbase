"""Classification: every edge candidate is *supported by*, *in support of* or *mention*.

One letter ask per candidate (:mod:`letters`), grouped by source claim in
ascending id, so every ask of a group opens with the source and its passages
and only the candidate differs. The letters a candidate is offered are its
:attr:`~.attribute.Candidate.offered` relations and no others; a reply naming
none of them is re-asked once and then takes the candidate's draft. With no
reader, every candidate takes its draft.

**Each group lands in the classification record as it completes**
(:data:`kb_pipeline.CLASSIFICATION_RELPATH`), and a resumed run asks only the
candidates the record does not hold, so a stop mid-stage costs at most the group
in flight. A candidate recorded *drafted* was held by no reader, and a run with
one asks it.

**What each candidate writes is :func:`attribute.written`'s**, and only then is
the set checked: every ``depends`` edge lying on a cycle of the classified set
is cut (:func:`attribute.cycle_edges`), keeping the relationship and giving up
only the direction the cycle disproves. No question is asked again about a
cycle. Every cut lands as a ``demoted`` record carrying its origin
(:func:`cuts`).
