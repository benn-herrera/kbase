"""Stage F — the write passes, through the write API and nothing else.

**Every metadata byte is composed by the write API**: values in, canonical bytes
out, each write proven by re-parsing with the production parser before it lands.
Nothing here spells a heading, a marker, a bullet or a frontmatter key. That is
what makes it safe for a later wave to hand a model a *title* and never a
heading.

**Five passes, and the order is forced by the ops' own preconditions.**

1. ``insert-claim-entry``, every entry edge-free — a batch cannot name one of
   its own members as a target, because ids are minted by the write itself.
   Minted ids come back in entry order.
1b. ``insert-work-entry``, one entry per external work a claim block cites —
   :func:`write_works`. It mints nothing: a work's id is derived from its
   citation key. It must precede pass 3, which names those ids as targets.
2. ``set-frontmatter``, one entry per document. Must follow pass 1: the op
   resolves every claim id against the authored register and refuses one that is
   not there.
3. ``add-build-edges``, one batch carrying every edge — :func:`write_edges`.
   Every target exists by now, so no ordering among edges is needed and none is
   imposed. It lands twice over a build's three invocations: the declared pass's
   off-graph edges here, and the discovered pass's dependency attribution
   between claims from there.
4. ``mark-claim-in-leaf``, one entry per id on each document declaring two or
   more. Must follow pass 2: the op refuses a marker whose id is not in the
   document's own declaration.

**The values file is the one thing this module composes, and it is proven.** The
transport is TOML, which is a format with a parser, so a hand-composed file is a
byte-fidelity demand — the class of demand this whole API exists to remove. The
composer therefore declares what each value must parse back as and the file is
put through :mod:`tomllib` before any op sees it; a mismatch stops the run at
the composition rather than at a refusal three layers down. Prose travels in
``'''`` literal blocks on a line of their own, so a title carrying backslashes,
``$``, backticks and closing quotes needs no escape grammar; the one sequence no
literal block can hold — ``'''`` itself — is refused here by name.

**A 7 stops the run**: the values are this stage's, so a refusal is a defect in
what it composed. **An 8 is re-issued identically**, per the contract's own
instruction — re-authoring values that were already correct is how a duplicate
id gets written.
