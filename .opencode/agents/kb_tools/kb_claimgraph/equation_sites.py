"""Where an equation node is stated: its fence, and the claim whose own body holds that fence.

An equation node is its ``(document, label)`` (:attr:`graph.ClaimNode.equation`),
and its fence is the first in that document carrying the label, as the minting
stage reads it. A claim whose body (:func:`hand_named.bodies`) holds that fence
*states* the equation rather than pointing at it, so the pair is no dependency
in either direction and no reference: the unmarked shortlist leaves it out of
the claim's pool, and :func:`attribute.narrow` drops it as a candidate.
