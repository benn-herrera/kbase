"""The authored claim graph, read back off the tree the passes before it wrote.

A pass that extends a graph has to read one first. Two authored artifacts hold
it and they are joined here rather than either being trusted alone:

* each document's ``claims:`` frontmatter, which is what the tier-1 coverage
  check reads and therefore the canonical statement of which document hosts
  which claim;
* each domain's register, which is where the id was minted and where its title
  lives.

**A claim is bound back to its block by title.** The declared pass reads a
block's title off its display line and writes that exact string as the register
entry's heading, so matching the two recovers which block a minted id came from
— and with it the locator a later stage needs to say *where in this document*
the claim sits.

**A prose claim has no block, and its marker is the only route back.** Claim
discovery mints a Tier-2 marker for every claim it identifies precisely so this
join has a second arm: the marker names the id and sits on the end of the line
its excerpt located to, so that line — its markers taken back off — *is* the
locator. Without it a prose claim's excerpt would exist only in the run's
scratch and every later stage would know the claim by path alone. The block join
runs first, because where a block carries the title the block's own display line
is the locator by construction.

**An equation node has neither, and its title is the route back.** A node minted
for a referenced equation (:mod:`equation`) sits in no block and takes no marker
— its ``\\label`` is inside a maths fence, which is a place no block-level
metadata may go — so both arms above answer ``None`` and the claim would come
back locatable only by path. The title is what carries the label
(:func:`kb_schema.equation_label`), so it is the third arm, and it runs
**first**: the title's shape is decisive, where the other two are lookups that
can miss for reasons of their own. The honest locator is the label itself, which
is the whole of what says *where in this document* an equation sits.

**Nothing here re-derives an id, a title or a host.** Every value is read off
the authored bytes; the only thing computed is the join.
