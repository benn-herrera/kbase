"""The prose a leaf states outside its blocks, and where each reference in it stands.

**Readable prose** is every line of a leaf outside its headings and its
claim-bearing, ``proof`` and ``definition`` blocks. Those blocks are read
mechanically — a claim block is its own node, a proof binds to the claim it
establishes, a definition is out of the graph — and a heading states nothing,
so the node pass reads what is left, and reads it through
:func:`label.render` with the blocks as its excluded region. That render is the
one paragraph rule: it decides the unit a verdict covers, a yes-claim's span,
which references stage D drops, and a paragraph's identity in the node-pass
record, which is the 0-based line the paragraph begins on.

**An obligated paragraph** is a paragraph of readable prose holding at least one
cross-reference that resolves to a document. Every one of them is owed exactly
one verdict by the node pass.

**Where a reference stands** (:func:`standing`) joins the render to the
record's verdicts, and :func:`claim_of` joins a yes-verdict's paragraph to the
Tier-2 marker its claim carries there. A paragraph with no verdict, or a
defaulted one, is unjudged and keeps today's rules; a reference is dropped only
on a recorded not-a-claim verdict.
