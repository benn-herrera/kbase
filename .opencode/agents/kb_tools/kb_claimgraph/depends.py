"""Dependency attribution: the edges between the claims the graph already holds.

**The passes are separate because inference is the part that needs repeating.**
A failed or improved inferential pass must not cost the mechanical work, and
must be re-runnable against a different model or a better ask without rebuilding
the tree. That is an operational property, and it is why this is a second
entry point over the first's output rather than a branch inside it.

**It runs after claim discovery** (:mod:`discover`), over a graph that by then
includes the claims nobody marked. Nothing here mints a node, and nothing there
authors an edge.

Stages, in order:

* **A′, :mod:`conform`** — the same structural checks the declared pass makes,
  and in place of its cleanliness check the per-document entry condition:
  :func:`conform.pass_two_gate`.
* **B, :mod:`inventory`** — the same scan. The tree gained metadata and no
  prose, so every claim site it found before is where it was.
* **:mod:`graph`** — the authored claim graph, read back off the tree's own
  declarations and registers.
* **D, :mod:`attribute`** — the narrowing: every edge candidate, from a
  reference, a hand-written name, or a pair the unmarked record holds answered
  yes (:func:`unmarked.found`, read and never recomputed), classed and
  drafted, with the drafts that
  lie on a containment ring drafted *mention*. Its harvest completes for the
  whole corpus before the first ask.
* **:mod:`classify`** — one letter ask per candidate, grouped by source, each
  group recorded as it lands; then every ``depends`` edge on a cycle of the
  classified set is cut, and every cut — those and the ring pairs that kept
  their drafted *mention* — lands as a ``demoted`` record carrying its origin
  (:func:`classify.cuts`). Inference reaches it through an
  injected :class:`~.letters.LetterReader`, which is why this pipeline takes a
  reader rather than building one.
* **F′, :func:`write.write_edges`** — pass 3 of the write path, one
  ``add-build-edges`` batch.
* **G, :mod:`gate`** — refresh, then the build-time check, in-process. Exits
  on the return codes.

**Nothing here exits on a model's opinion.** Every stage ends on a comparison
between two artifacts or on a return code; a reply carrying no offered letter
takes the candidate's draft, and only a call that never completes stops it.

**Only the asking is conditional.** ``reader=None`` is a run with no model
reachable, and every stage above still runs: such a run writes every
candidate's draft — *supported by* where containment directed the pair and no
ring refused it, *mention* everywhere else — so no relationship the corpus
states goes unrecorded. The report says which run it was, because a candidate
drafted and one a model answered write the same record.
