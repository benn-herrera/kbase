"""The off-graph endcap — the works a claim rests on and this corpus does not hold.

A claim that depends on nothing and a claim that depends on unreachable external
work are the same thing in an edge count: zero. They are not the same epistemic
state, and the second is the ordinary one — every ``\\cite`` inside a claim block
is an instance. This stage is what makes the difference visible: a claim resting
on outside work says so, by an edge to a node standing for the work.

**The node is the cited work, and its identity is the citation key.** The key is
what a citation carries, and one key is one work everywhere in the corpus — a
build resolves every citation against one merged collection, whatever number of
``.bib`` files it was assembled from, so a key names one entry however many times
and in however many volumes it is cited. That is what makes the id corpus-unique
without a minting scheme; :func:`kb_schema.work_id` derives it from the key. The
node is therefore tied to the bibliography and **not** to the per-volume
``references.md`` leaves: a work three volumes cite is one node, because its
standing is a property of the work. Those leaves are *citers* of it, which is
what they already are in prose.

**The trigger is mechanical and asks nobody anything.** It is a comparison of
:attr:`inventory.Citation.line` against a run of lines the claim owns — both
already in stage B's inventory, both read off the rendered page. Nothing here is
inferred, and nothing here may be: a *confident* number about a paper no model in
this build has read is worse than a blank, so neither score this stage authors is
given a default, a heuristic or a fallback. The node's standing and the pairing's
applicability both land as the pending literal and stay there until a person
replaces them.

**Two runs of lines are a claim's, and the second is where the warrants are.**
The first is the block itself — and in the surveyed corpus that population is
almost entirely the theorem environment's *optional argument*, an author writing
``\\begin{lemma}[Yamabe stability, Engelstein–Neumayer–Spolaor \\cite{ENS22}]``,
which attributes the whole statement. The second is **the body of the proof that
establishes it**. A proof establishes the claim it belongs to, so what the proof
leans on the claim leans on — the ruling stage D already directs a ``\\ref`` by
(:mod:`attribute`) — and a ``\\cite`` is the same relation reaching outside the
corpus instead of inside it. Measured over 25 built arXiv KBs: 8 citations sit
inside claim blocks and 68 inside proofs, so reading only the first is reading
the attribution and not the warrant. *"By the Sobolev–Morrey embedding theorem
(Adams and Fournier 2003, Theorem 4.12)"* is what the second population looks
like.

**Which claim a proof proves is not decided here.** It is
:attr:`inventory.Inventory.proofs`, the same reading stage D directs a ``\\ref``
by; this module joins citations to spans and never asks what a proof is. A second
derivation of what a proof proves could disagree with that one about the corpus,
and there is no third artifact to break the tie.

**A key survives with no bibliography behind it.** ``data-cites`` carries the key
whatever became of it, so a key-only citation still yields a node: *this claim
rests on ``nobody2026``, and we know nothing else about it* is a fact worth
recording and is what the corpus itself says. Where a bibliography did answer,
the reference list's own rendered text becomes the node's title, so a resolved
work is named by its author, year and title and an unanswered or key-only one by
the key alone. That difference is what the node carries, and its rationale says
which of the two it is.
