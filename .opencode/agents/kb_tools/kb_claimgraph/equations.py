"""The ``equations-minted`` stage: the node set's last mechanical addition.

A referenced equation nothing else holds is minted as an ordinary ``clm-``
node (:mod:`equation` says which, :func:`assemble.equation_entries` arranges
them). It is minted here rather than in the declared pass because **a reference
counts only where the node pass did not judge its paragraph not a claim**
(:func:`prose.standing`): stage D drops such a reference, so an equation it
alone named would be a node nothing points at. Under ``--no-inference`` the node
pass judged nothing, every reference counts, and this stage mints exactly what
the declared pass once did.

Mechanical end to end, and resumable: an equation already minted is skipped,
and each leaf lands through :func:`write.land_leaf`, which completes an
interrupted write rather than repeating it. **It exits on a comparison**: the
equation nodes the tree now holds are exactly the counting set.
