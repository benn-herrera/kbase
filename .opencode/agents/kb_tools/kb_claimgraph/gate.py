"""Stage G — refresh, then the build-time check, in-process.

Refresh rebuilds the derived index from what the earlier stages authored;
:func:`kb_tools.kb_util.run_build_verify` then runs the standard check and the
citation-grammar check over the result. Each verifier prints its own report as
it runs.

**This is the loop that works: it exits on return codes.** There is no fix loop
here and no seat to run one. Every check compares one mechanical product against
another — a rebuild diffed against disk, a link against the file it names, an id
against the register that mints it — so a red gate is a defect in this stage's
input or in this stage, and neither is repaired by asking.
