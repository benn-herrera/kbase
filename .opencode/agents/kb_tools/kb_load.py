"""The KB's format version first; its files as the current format reads them; the one save that migrates.

`open_kb` reads `kb-format` from `kb-root/entry-point.md` before anything else and refuses a KB
newer than this toolchain reads. A KB stamped at the current major and minor version is read from
disk; an older one is read converted (`kb_migrate.chain`), each file in the form found, a renamed
file from its old spelling where that still stands. `land_migration` writes the conversion: every
covered file but the entry point, then the obsolete paths removed, then the stamped entry point
last — so an interrupted landing leaves the KB reading as its old version, and the next one
completes it.

Files are decoded UTF-8 with no newline translation, so a CRLF document keeps its bytes. This module
is also the one composer of index and build-record paths.
