"""Regenerate derived KB metadata fields from leaf claims.

Side-effecting: writes to the frontmatter block of every ``kind: index`` /
``kind: entry-point`` node — whatever its filename — and to the derived
``solidity`` fields of every ``claim-quality.md`` register. Idempotent. Run via
the project's refresh target (or directly as
``python3 -m kb_tools.refresh_kb_metadata``).

Currently regenerates:
    * ``subtree-claims`` and ``subtree-experiments`` on every ``kind: index``
      and ``kind: entry-point`` node, discovered by kind (never by filename)
      from the same ``kb_index_lib.discover_kb`` state the verifier enumerates
    * the ``- solidity:`` line of every claim entry in every ``claim-quality.md``
      register — value, build-status phrase, and arithmetic trace are all
      derived from the hand-authored ``confidence`` values via
      ``kb_index_lib.compute_solidity``
    * the ``(solidity X)`` annotation in every claim-target depends-on bullet,
      synced to the depended-on claim's computed solidity
    * the index streams, ``.index/*.yaml``
    * the claim-graph sheets — ``claim-graph.svg`` at the KB root and, where two
      or more volumes hold nodes, ``claim-graph-digest.svg`` beside it and each
      such volume's ``claim-graph.svg`` — drawn from the index just written
      through ``claim_sheet.render``

On a KB in an older metadata format it first lands the migration
(``kb_load.land_migration``) and then refreshes the migrated KB; on a newer one
it refuses and writes nothing.

It holds the KB write lock (``kb_lock``) from its first read to its last write,
and exits 8 where another writer held it past the wait. Run as a command it is
also refused, exit 7, while a build runs; every file it writes is replaced
atomically.

Future: bootstrap directive blockquote text (currently hand-maintained).

This script does NOT verify; it ONLY refreshes. Run the project's verify
target afterward to confirm the result is internally consistent.
