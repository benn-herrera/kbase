"""Shared utility and vocabulary module for the KB toolchain.

Two kinds of single-sourced truth live here: KB path construction and the
maintenance-command hints that build-side scripts emit in remediation text.

Both the build-side scripts (``kb_tools/``) and the read-side query package
(``kb_tools/kb_cmd/``) resolve every ``kb-root/`` path through this module
rather than constructing the literals themselves.

Root discovery is lazy and cwd-anchored: the consuming repo's root is found
by :func:`find_repo_root`, which walks up from the current working directory
to the first directory containing a ``.git`` entry (a directory, or the file
a linked git worktree carries) and requires the ``kb-root/`` content tree
beside it. The repo root is never derived from ``__file__``: that only ever
describes where the tools were installed, not the repo being worked on. What
``__file__`` does decide is which harness the toolchain is installed under, and
with it every harness-named path spelled relative to the repo root: the scratch
directory, the PYTHONPATH entry, the runner include line
(:mod:`kb_tools.install_location`).

Maintenance-command hints (:func:`refresh_cmd` / :func:`verify_cmd`) are
detected, not configured: a ``justfile`` at the detected root selects
``just <target>``, a ``Makefile`` selects ``make <target>`` (justfile wins
when both are present), and with neither the hint falls back to the raw
``python3 -m kb_tools.<module>`` invocation, which always works.

The module doubles as the KB build's mechanical front end. Run as a CLI —
``python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util <op> [options]`` — it manages the single include
line through which a consuming repo's runner (justfile or Makefile) gains
the KB maintenance targets (``install-targets`` / ``uninstall-targets``);
initialises the claim-graph metadata spine over an already-built document tree
under ``graph-init`` (index directory, include line, refresh, verify); reports
the build environment
under ``preflight``; and drives the build's stage ledger through
``show-status`` / ``start-build`` / ``advance-step``, with ``show-stage-status``
reading one stage's coverage beside them.

The target definitions themselves ship in ``runner-snippets/`` (``kb.just`` /
``kb.mk``) and are included from the installed tree, never copied into the
consumer's file.

``validate-build`` joins that op set as the built-tree validator's front end:
handed a KB tree, it walks that tree and checks its structure. The tree is the
whole of what it is told, and the tree is produced upstream of this op.

``show-run-lock`` reports the repository's run lock — held, naming the running
build's state dir, or absent — so a caller outside ``kb_driver`` (a staging
recipe about to wipe a workspace) can ask whether a build is running in this
repository. It writes nothing and takes no lock: the answer is ``kb_lock``'s,
and it rides stdout rather than the exit status.

``await-build`` waits on the build the runner's ``kb-build`` target launched
detached, in :func:`build_live_dir`, and prints where it stands; it too writes
nothing and takes no lock. :func:`build_cmd` is the command a relay card names
to run that build again.

The metadata **write** ops — :data:`WRITE_OPS` — join the set as the front
end of ``kb_write``. Each takes its values in a TOML
file named by ``--values`` rather than on the command line, and the register
inserts alone take ``--create``. Their semantics — the validation ladder, the
refusal reasons, the report lines and the exit codes — live entirely in
``kb_write.ops`` with no argparse in the picture; what is here is the surface
binding and one adapter, so nothing about an op changes when its surface does.

Each op is an ``argparse`` subcommand owning its own options, so a companion
that belongs to one op cannot be spelled on another: an invalid pairing is
unrepresentable rather than policed.

Stdlib only.

# there — and the no-downgrade test enumerates this option surface, every
# subcommand of it, to keep it that way.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# root discovery, and it calls the `run_*` function above with the arguments
# that function already takes. Root discovery lives here rather than in one
# if-chain because here it cannot be reached by the wrong op.
#
# `preflight`, `graph-init`, `show-status`, `show-stage-status`,
# `start-build`, `advance-step` and
# `show-run-lock` anchor on `find_git_root()`: each reports on, or creates, an
# environment that may have no KB yet. The two record ops are there because the
# ledger is the commit trail: a build's first stages are recorded before anything
# has created `kb-root/` — the tree is the `document-graph` stage's own product,
# and the stage that opens the build precedes it. The lock read is there because
# the lock is the repository's, and its caller is often one that is about to
# remove `kb-root/` or has already.
# `install-targets`, `uninstall-targets`, the write ops and the one
# read-only metadata op anchor on `find_repo_root()`, which additionally
# requires the KB tree — the read-only op among them because a citation is
# checked against the KB it will live in.
# The survey op and the validator discover no root at all — they read the
# paths they are handed, which is how the driver invokes them from its
# scratch tree and how an agent invokes them against the path its assignment
# carries.
