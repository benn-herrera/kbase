"""The read-modify-write path over authored Markdown.

``render.py`` composes the bytes; this module is what puts them on disk without
ever leaving a file holding bytes nobody proved. The ladder it runs:

2. **Path containment** — every target resolves inside ``kb-root/`` after
   symlink resolution *and names a file in it*, or is refused **unread and
   unwritten**. A value that resolves to the root itself, or that no
   filesystem can hold (a NUL byte), is refused here rather than at the first
   ``open`` — see :func:`resolve_target`.
4. **Census, before** — for each register the op will touch, the count of
   canonical ``<!-- id: … -->`` markers equals the count of records the
   production parser returns, **and every marker binds to a heading of its
   own**. A pre-existing mismatch is a refusal naming the defect and the file:
   the op will not write into a register that is already losing entries.
   Counting alone cannot see the same defect one heading earlier — a marker
   bound to the *wrong* heading leaves the counts equal — so the census asks the
   binding question too (``kb_index_lib.mis_bound_entries``). A census is
   believed only if the file held still while it was taken: it is several opens
   of one name, and a concurrent publish between two of them describes no
   version of the file (:func:`_compose`).
6. **Write the temp** — beside the target, so ``os.replace`` is a rename within
   one directory and therefore atomic. Nothing else on disk has changed. Steps
   6, 7 and 8 run with the target's directory held (:func:`_exclusive`); the
   first act under that lock is to unlink any publish temp a killed writer left
   beside the target (:func:`_sweep_orphan_temps`). ``tempfile.mkstemp`` makes
   its file ``0600`` by design, and ``os.replace`` carries a file's permission
   bits with it rather than the destination name's — the replace is a rename,
   not a copy, so what lands under the target's name is the temp's own inode
   with the temp's own mode. Left alone that would narrow every file this API
   touches to owner-only on every write, silently, which is not this API's
   change to make: :func:`_target_mode` sets the temp's mode before it is ever
   proven, to a pre-existing target's own mode or, for a creation, to what an
   ordinary create would get under the process umask (see
   :func:`_default_file_mode`) — never a hard-coded ``0644``.
7. **Prove the temp** — re-parse it with the *production* parsers, match
   every intended record field by field against the values supplied, re-run the
   census on it, and assert the record count is step 4's plus the intended
   delta. Any failure discards the temp and refuses; the live file was never
   written, so there is nothing to restore and no window to be killed in. A
   ``sup-`` entry is read by two of those parsers — its own fields by
   ``parse_support_quality_entries`` and its staged ``supports:`` fan-out by
   ``parse_register_staged_supports`` — because the entry has two grammars and
   proving one of them is proving half a write.
8. **``os.replace``, under the freshness check** — the live file's content must still
   equal what step 4 read. If it does not, a concurrent writer intervened: the
   temp is discarded and the outcome is **retry**, never a merge and never a
   silent overwrite. The check and the replace run inside one critical section
   held against every other writer of the same file (:func:`_exclusive`), and
   the compared read is taken **inside** it: a check whose answer is computed
   outside the exclusion answers a question about a moment that has already
   passed. See below.

**Why step 8 is one critical section and not two steps.** With the check loop
and the replace loop adjacent but unguarded, every writer in a wave reads the
same baseline, proves its own temp, sees the baseline still live, and replaces
unconditionally: the last replace wins and overwrites the entries the others
have just published. Nothing reports it — each writer's own record survives its
own temp, so the readback passes for all of them; each file is internally
complete, so the census passes too; and all of them exit 0. Measured at three
concurrent inserts into one register, that shape lost an entry in **22 of 25
rounds and reported 34 ids minted with no entry anywhere in the KB** — precisely
the ghost-id state mint fusion exists to make unconstructible. The window is
small and the loss rate 88%, which is the ordinary shape of a race: rare per
instruction, near-certain per wave. The exclusion below closes it, and
``test_writeapi_concurrency.py`` is the probe that measured it, kept as a test.

**Where the exclusion starts, and why it is not the check.** The section opens
before the first temp is written rather than at the check, because the same lock
carries the orphaned-temp sweep and a temp is only provably an orphan while
nobody else can be making one. What stays *outside* it is the read, the census
and the splice — the expensive half, and the half a second writer must be able
to interleave with, since a writer that composed against a baseline someone has
since replaced is exactly the writer the freshness check must answer *retry* to.

**Three outcomes, not two.** :class:`Outcome` carries ``written`` /
``refused`` / ``retry``, and the distinction is not cosmetic: *refused* means
the values are wrong and must be fixed, *retry* means the values were right and
the write did not happen for a reason nothing about them can fix. Re-asking a
model for values that were already correct is how a duplicate id gets written.
Process exit codes (7 and 8) are ``ops.py``'s mapping of these; nothing here
knows an exit code, and nothing here composes a report line.

**All-or-nothing per invocation.** Every edit in a batch is prepared and
proven before any of them is replaced, and the freshness check runs over every
target before the first replace. A batch that refuses any entry writes none. The
critical section covers steps 6 through 8 for *every* target at once, so a
batch's targets are checked and replaced with all of them held: no target may
move between the first check and the last replace.

**Where all-or-nothing stops, and what is reported there.** Every *verdict* on
the values is reached before the first replace,
so no batch is ever half-refused. The one thing that can still fail partway is
the replace loop itself — ENOSPC, EIO, a quota, a permission change on one
directory of several — and across several directories that is not fixable
without a journal, which this toolchain does not have. So it is *reported*
instead of pretended away: :class:`BatchInterrupted` names the target that could
not be replaced and lists the ones already committed, and the caller sees the
environment's exit code (never *refused* or *retry* — the values were right).
What this module must never do is raise a bare ``OSError`` after committing part
of a batch, leaving the caller with ``written=()`` on a run that wrote.

**Register creation is explicit.** A target that does not exist is a
refusal naming the path unless the caller opted in with ``Edit(create=True)`` —
a typo'd register path can no longer succeed into a fresh, empty file.

**The temp's placement.**
``ClaimEntry.canonical_path`` and ``canonical_anchor`` are derived by the parser
from the parsed file's own ``relative_to(kb_root)``, so a temp that is not the
target makes those two fields differ from the target's for a reason the op never
supplied. Of the two possible answers this module takes the second: **the temp is
a sibling of the target and the two path-derived fields are excluded from the
readback comparison by name** — :data:`PATH_DERIVED_FIELDS`, with
``test_kb_write_store.py`` asserting that every field of ``ClaimEntry`` is either
compared or named in one of the two exclusion tuples, so the exclusion cannot
silently grow. The compared half of that partition is :data:`COMPARED_FIELD_READS`,
which is the map :func:`_mismatched_fields` iterates — one object, so a field
declared compared *is* compared. A guard certifying one tuple while a separate
literal did the comparing would make "declared compared" and "compared" two
independent facts with a green test between them.

The other answer — a temp whose ``relative_to(kb_root)`` equals the target's —
fails on two counts, both fatal rather than aesthetic. It requires a
mirror directory tree, and that tree has to sit on the target's own filesystem
for ``os.replace`` to stay atomic, which puts a second file named
``claim-quality.md`` **inside ``kb-root/``**: ``scan_authored_ids`` walks
``kb_root.rglob("claim-quality.md")``, so a concurrent reader would see every id
in the temp as a duplicate register entry — this API's own uniqueness question
answered wrong, by this API's own scratch file. The sibling temp is invisible to
both KB walks by construction (see :data:`TEMP_SUFFIX`), and nothing is lost by
the exclusion: ``canonical_anchor`` is a pure function of the heading title,
which *is* compared, and ``canonical_path`` is a pure function of the path the
op itself named.

**Derived fields are not compared and not supplied.** ``solidity``,
``build_status`` and ``solidity_trace`` are ``refresh``'s;
:class:`ExpectedEntry` has no field for any of them, so there is nothing for the
readback to match and no path by which this module could write one.
:data:`DERIVED_FIELDS` names them so the structural test above stays total.

**Dependency direction**: ``store`` → ``kb_index_lib`` (the production
parsers, for readback and location) and ``render`` (the prose collapse the
comparison is well-posed in), plus the standard library. It computes no derived
value, imports no solidity machinery, does not know what a build band is, and
writes nothing under ``.index/``. ``fcntl`` is stdlib but POSIX-only, which
matches the rest of the toolchain's assumptions (``os.replace`` over a sibling
temp, a git-backed KB) and keeps the stdlib-only rule whole: closing the race
needs no third-party dependency.

    """Run the write path over a batch of edits, all-or-nothing.

    Two phases, and the boundary between them is the whole of this module's
    concurrency argument.

    **Unlocked** (:func:`_compose`, steps 2, 4 and 5): contain the path, read
    the live file, census it, splice the candidate. Every one of these is a read
    or a pure computation over what was read, none of them touches a file
    another writer can see, and the expensive half of a write is here rather
    than inside an exclusion. A splice that must parse what it composed takes
    the target's directory for itself, briefly, through :func:`proof_temp` —
    which is why nothing here may already hold it.

    **Locked** (steps 6, 7 and 8, with every target's directory held): sweep
    orphaned publish temps, write this write's temps, prove them, check that
    every target still holds the bytes its baseline was read from, and
    replace. It is one section from the first temp to the last replace, because a
    publish temp is only provably an orphan while nobody else can be making one,
    and because a check whose answer is computed outside the exclusion answers a
    question about a moment that has already passed.

    So: a batch that refuses any entry writes none; a concurrent writer's entry
    cannot be overwritten by one of these replaces; and a kill at any point
    leaves each file holding either its prior content or the proven candidate —
    there is no third state and therefore no rollback path to get wrong.

    The *retry* consequence is intended, not conceded: a writer whose baseline moved
    while it was composing finds it moved when it takes the lock, and answers
    *retry* rather than merging.

    Raises ``ValueError`` on an empty batch, and :class:`BatchInterrupted` — an
    ``OSError`` — when a replace fails: both are the environment being unfit
    rather than a verdict on the values, which is a different exit code and
    ``ops.py``'s to map. The exception carries the targets that landed before
    the failure, because a nine-entry wave that half-landed and a wave that did
    nothing are different situations and the caller has to tell them apart.
