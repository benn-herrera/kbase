"""Op semantics — the validation ladder, mint fusion, report lines, refusal codes.

**Surface-independent by construction.** There is no ``argparse`` here, no
``sys.argv``, and no ``sys.exit``. Every op's inputs, validation ladder, refusal
reasons, report lines and exit code are defined and tested in this module; the
CLI is a thin adapter that binds a surface shape to them. Whether these ops are
exposed as flags or as subcommands is therefore a change to the CLI and nothing
else.

**The ladder, in order.** Steps 1–4 refuse before anything is composed;
5–7 compose and prove; only step 8 touches a live file. Ahead of step 1 the
KB's format is read (:func:`kb_load.require_current`): a KB older or newer than
the format these ops write is exit 2, because a save into it would mix two
formats, and an older one names the refresh that migrates it.

1. **Well-formedness** — delegated whole to :mod:`values`. The grammar, the
   closed per-op key vocabulary and the inherited value domains are that
   module's, and a refusal it returns names the field and the located line.
2. **Path containment** — every target resolves inside ``kb-root/`` after
   symlink resolution, through :func:`store.resolve_target`, before any id is
   resolved and before anything is rendered.
3. **Reference closure and uniqueness** — two questions, through the two
   functions that answer them, **uniqueness asked first**. That order is the
   driver's existing rule (``run.py:1845-1849``) — every later reading is taken
   over a map keyed by id,
   so asking about duplicates afterwards would be asking a question of a damaged
   answer. :func:`kb_index_lib.scan_duplicate_register_ids` reports a collision
   that :func:`kb_index_lib.scan_authored_ids` **structurally cannot see**: the
   inventory is keyed by id and keeps the first keyer, so a duplicate register
   entry looks exactly like a clean inventory. Both scans read the whole store
   before step 2 has looked at the target, so both are wrapped
   (:func:`_scanned`): a file under ``kb-root/`` that will not decode is the
   located exit 2 of :class:`_Unreadable`, never a traceback.
4. **Census**, 5. **render**, 6. **temp**, 7. **prove**, 8. **replace** — all
   :func:`store.apply_edits`'s. This module composes the ``Edit`` batch and the
   expected records; it never opens a live KB file for writing.

**One file, one edit.** A values file may carry a batch, and a scoring
wave's batch is ordinarily bound for a single register. Two edits naming one
path both splice from the same baseline, so ``store`` refuses the pair rather
than letting the second silently drop the first; this module therefore folds
every entry bound for one file into one edit (:func:`_batch`), summing their
deltas and proving all of their records against the one finished candidate.

**Mint fusion**, over ``clm-``, ``sup-`` and ``exp-`` alike. An insert op
mints the id itself and writes its canonical entry in the same act. There is no
reachable path that produces an id without its entry, and no reachable path that
writes an entry for an id the tool did not mint — **structurally**, not by
discipline: an insert op's inputs are exactly its own parameters plus the closed
values vocabulary of :data:`values.OP_FIELDS`, and neither channel admits a node
id for the entry being created. The draw is
:func:`kb_schema.mint_id`, collision-checked against both scans.
``test_kb_write_ops.py`` asserts the partition over the whole of :data:`OPS`, so
a future op that accepted an id for insert fails there rather than shipping.

**Three outcomes, three codes.** :class:`ExitCode` and
:data:`EXIT_FOR_STATUS` are the stable mapping the CLI binds and ``ledger.py``'s
per-op ``exits`` vocabulary enrolls. **7 — refused**: the values are
wrong; fix them and call again — or a build is running, and the call waits for
it. **8 — retry unchanged**: the values were right and the write did not happen
for a reason nothing about them can fix — a concurrent writer moved the file,
or held the KB write lock past the wait.
**2 — environment unfit**: an unresolvable root, an unreadable tree, a KB not
in the current metadata format, a usage error. Re-asking a model for values that
were already correct is how a duplicate id gets written, which is why 7 and 8
are not one code.

**Report lines, not a logging framework.** Output is the existing uniform
``[<tag>] STATUS name detail`` convention (``kb_util.PreflightItem``), with
``PASS``/``FAIL`` gating, ``FACT`` never gating, and every failure detail
carrying an inline ``restore:`` clause naming the corrective call. Nothing here
prints: :class:`Result` carries the lines and the exit code, and the surface
decides where they go. A ``restore:`` clause names the *op* and the corrective
action rather than a literal command line, because no site outside the CLI's
own invocation constant may hand-write one.

**Dependency direction**: ``ops`` → :mod:`values`, :mod:`store`,
:mod:`render`, :mod:`kb_index_lib`'s two scan functions and production parsers,
:mod:`kb_schema`'s mint, ``kb_util``'s report-status tokens, and
:mod:`kb_load`'s format gate and document reader. Plus
:mod:`kb_links`, for the one thing that module owns: the link primitive every
gate reads a markdown link with. It dispatches no inference, composes no brief,
names no stage id and names no record verb — and it still imports no
``verify_*`` module, which is why the read-only op reaches the citation gate's
checks through objects the gate shares rather than through the gate.

**Three registries, one vocabulary.** :data:`OPS` is the write surface a
surface binds, :data:`READ_OPS` is the one op that reads to verify and prints,
and :data:`BUILD_OPS` is what only the build issues, bound by no surface. They
are disjoint, and their union is exactly :data:`values.OP_FIELDS`' key set.

**Seven in-package reaches, all deliberate, all for one reason**: the alternative
to each is a second copy of a rule that already has exactly one owner, which is
where drift starts. :class:`store._Refused` is caught around
:func:`store.resolve_target` so step 2 runs in its stated place without a second
implementation of the containment rule; store's two fold-break patterns bound
the depends-on bullet insert rather than a re-typed key list;
``render._format_score`` renders a rigor value's text;
``kb_index_lib._declared_node_ids`` is what decides which frontmatter entries
declare a node; ``kb_index_lib._SUPPORTS_PAIR_RE`` is what decides where a staged
fan-out block ends; and ``kb_index_lib._parse_depends_on_line`` is what says
which edge a rendered depends-on bullet *is*, which is the question
:func:`_reader_target` has to answer to tell a new edge from one already there;
``kb_index_lib._parse_demoted_line`` answers the same of a demoted bullet for
:func:`_drop_demoted`.
Each is the same reach ``store`` itself makes into ``kb_index_lib``'s compiled
patterns, for the same reason.

**The leaf-writing ops carry their own readback.** ``store``'s proof
surface is register-shaped — :class:`store.ExpectedEntry` carries a register
entry's fields and its census counts register records — so a leaf write proves
nothing there. Those ops therefore prove their candidate through the production
*leaf* parsers, inside the splice callable, on a temp beside the target: the
same act, the same pair of writer and reader, and still before any live file is
touched. A mismatch raises out of :func:`store.apply_edits`, whose ``finally``
removes every temp on any path out, including "an exception nobody anticipated".
**What each of those readbacks covers is declared** in
:data:`LEAF_PROOF_COVERAGE` and asserted against each op's values vocabulary, so
a field that reaches a document with nothing reading it back is a failing test
rather than a silently uncovered case.

    A ``sup-`` entry's staged fan-out is part of "nothing else moved" and is

# "the excerpt appears at the target" would print citations the gate rejects,
# which is the failure this op exists to remove rather than relocate.
#
# **Deliberately NOT mirrored: an ambiguity refusal.** The gate asks whether
# the excerpt appears in the cited section and asks nothing else, so a clause
# occurring twice there is a citation it passes; refusing it here would be this
# program authoring a rule of its own. `mark-claim-in-leaf`'s ambiguity
# refusal answers a different question — where to PUT a marker, which has one

#: The build's write surface — ops only the build issues, in-process. No

#: runner target.

#: The read surface — a **sibling** registry, deliberately not a row of
#: :data:`OPS`. Everything keyed off the write registry is a statement
#: about writing: a 7 tells the caller its values were refused and an 8 that a
#: file was contended, re-run unchanged — and a read op has no 8 to earn, having
#: nothing to contend over. The mint partition walks
#: ``OPS`` asking which ops mint; a read op mints nothing and would answer
#: vacuously in every clause.
#:
#: The three registries are disjoint by test, and their union is exactly the
#: closed vocabulary of :data:`values.OP_FIELDS`: a values row with no op, or
#: an op with no vocabulary, is drift between the surface an agent writes
#: against and the surface this package checks.
