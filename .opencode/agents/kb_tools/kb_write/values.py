"""The values-file grammar and the closed field vocabulary.

This module answers exactly one question: **is this a well-formed value?** It
never touches the KB, never opens a file under ``kb-root/``, and never resolves
an id — "does this id exist?" is ``ops.py``'s question against the store, and
"does this path resolve inside ``kb-root/``?" is ``store.py``'s. What it owns is
the grammar, the closed per-op key vocabulary, the inherited value domains, and
a **located refusal** for every value it will not accept.

**Transport: TOML via :mod:`tomllib`, prose in ``'''`` literal blocks.** Prose
in this corpus routinely carries ``$``, backslashes, backticks and quotes; a
literal block holds all of it with no escape grammar, which is what keeps the
byte-fidelity demand from being relocated one layer out instead of removed. Four
grammar rules are binding and are implemented here:

1. **The op travels on argv and never inside the file.** ``parse_values``
   takes the op as an argument; a top-level ``op`` key in the file is a second
   source for which op is running, and is refused as an unknown top-level key.
2. **One array-of-tables name, ``[[entry]]``, across every op.** The op fixes
   what an entry means. A per-op table name would make this grammar nine
   grammars and these refusal messages nine vocabularies. One file may carry a
   batch of entries; the batch is all-or-nothing, so a refusal anywhere
   refuses the file.
3. **The key vocabulary is closed and total.** An unrecognized key is a located
   refusal, never ignored — a silently dropped key is the same failure class
   this whole program exists to remove, in a new layer.
4. **A refusal names the key and the line**, and for the two failure modes a
   caller cannot see says which convention was expected: a path given
   repo-root-relative rather than kb-root-relative, and a prose value that
   embeds ``'''``, which no TOML literal block can hold because it is the
   block's own delimiter.

**Nothing here is coerced, defaulted, substituted, or repaired.** A missing
required key is a refusal, not a default. The single value transform in this
package — whitespace-run collapse inside a single-paragraph prose field — is
``render.py``'s; this module returns every prose value exactly as supplied. A
value that *cannot* survive the reader's grammar — a rationale carrying a blank
line, whose remainder the fold discards before normalization ever runs
(``kb_index_lib.py:987-991``) — is **refused here**, naming the line, never
collapsed and never truncated.

**Every numeric bound below is inherited**; this program authors none of its
own, and none on prose length, field size, entry count, or file size appears
anywhere:

* ``rigor`` (the one concept behind the on-disk ``confidence:`` and
  ``quality:`` fields) — a number in ``[0, 1]`` or the literal ``*pending*``
  (``verify_kb_metadata.py:185``, ``check_confidence_values``: the range and
  the pending literal are what is mechanically enforced — the rubric's named
  grades are an authoring convention, not a check).
* an on-point ``fraction`` — ``[0, 1]`` or ``*pending*``
  (:func:`kb_index_lib.parse_support_leaf` and
  :class:`kb_index_lib.SupportLeafError`'s docstring).
* a citation ``excerpt`` — at most :data:`EXCERPT_MAX_CHARS` characters
  (``verify_citations.py:92``).
* a ``strengthens`` pair's ``strength`` — ``[0, 1]`` (SPEC.md, Claim-Graph
  Nodes and Edges, the edge-class table's ``strengthens`` row). The verifier
  requires the value to be non-null and inside the same domain, so a strength
  beyond it — which renders a solidity the build-band ladder has no band
  for — is refused at both ends rather than only here.

Numbers are written by ``render._format_score`` as Python's shortest
round-tripping repr — deliberately, since rounding an authored ``0.875`` would
be a near-miss coercion — and read back by ``kb_schema.number_token``, whose
grammar accepts every token that repr emits, exponent notation included. The
two non-finite floats are not a separate case: ``nan`` and ``inf`` fall outside
every per-field domain above and are refused there, naming the domain.

**Dependency direction**: this module imports :mod:`kb_tools.kb_schema` and the
standard library, and nothing else. In particular it does **not** import
:mod:`render`, which is why the value carriers below mirror render's dataclasses
rather than reusing them; ``ops.py`` maps one onto the other. :mod:`pathlib` is
admissible here and is not in ``render.py``: the values file is the
*agent-supplied values* boundary, not the KB, and reading it under a pinned
strict UTF-8 decode is this module's job.

**Report lines are not composed here.** A refusal is returned as data —
:class:`Refusal`, carrying the offending field, the located line, and the
entry — because rendering the ``[<tag>] STATUS name detail`` line and its
``restore:`` clause needs the invocation, which is ``ops.py``'s to know.
