"""One tool-less chat call, made directly to the server ``liaison_tools``' environment names.

A system prompt, a user prompt, and the reply text back, through
``liaison_tools.openai_chat`` — the chat-completions request ``post-openai.py``
is built on.

**The environment is ``post-openai.py``'s**, the format a ``reaper-*.env`` file
holds: :data:`BASE_URL_ENV` is the API root, ``/v1`` included, and the request
goes to its ``/chat/completions``; :data:`MODEL_ENV` is the model;
:data:`KEY_FILE_ENV` names the file holding the key, which is read and
validated by ``openai_chat.read_api_key``, as ``post-openai.py``'s is; and
:data:`ALLOW_HTTP_ENV` set to exactly ``1`` accepts plaintext http to a
non-loopback host, as it does there. ``TEMPERATURE`` is not read: the request
always carries temperature 0. :func:`check_environment` is the one validation
of it, and :func:`call_chat` runs it on every call.

The request offers no tools, sends ``chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking:
false`` and temperature 0, and asks for the usage chunk. ``liaison_tools`` is
imported at the call, not at import, so this package imports where it is not
installed and only a call needs it.

**The capture** appends, per call, every SSE data payload verbatim, one JSON
object per line, then one line closing the attempt:
``{"type": REQUEST_RECORD, "duration_ms": <the request's measured time>,
"outcome": <Outcome value>}``. Neither the key nor the base URL is ever
written there or logged. :func:`read_capture` is its one reader.

**How a call ended**: a stream that failed before, during or short of
``[DONE]`` is ``TRANSPORT_FAILURE``, and a stream that reached ``[DONE]`` is
``OK`` — an empty reply, and a reply the server cut off at its token limit,
included; the cut is logged. The reply text is the content the turn wrote,
whatever tool call a server injected beside it. ``timeout_seconds`` bounds
each blocking socket operation — the connect and each read of the stream — and
nothing bounds the call as a whole.

Stdlib only.
