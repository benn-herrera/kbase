"""relay-driver.py — the corpus-relay eval instrument.

Runs budgeted, fresh-history question/answer conversations against a guest
model reached through ``post-openai.py``, servicing READ/LIST/GREP requests
against a read-only corpus. Promoted from the docent-headroom retrieval-test
driver; deliberately the concrete corpus-relay instrument, not a generalized
pluggable-protocol conversation framework.

Contract highlights:

- **The instrument owns the protocol grammar, both sides.** The relay
  protocol text lives in exactly one place — ``PROTOCOL_BLOCK`` below. The
  driver appends that block (clearly delimited) to the caller's system
  prompt, and its classifier services exactly the grammar the block
  describes. Callers supply navigation doctrine only.
- **Token usage** comes from ``post-openai.py``'s ``USAGE_STATS_FILE`` side
  channel (one JSON line per successful call), set per question inside the
  question's session directory and aggregated into ``stats.csv``. Debug
  streams are never scraped.
- **Composition**: ``post-openai.py`` is the only transport, ``msg-util.py``
  the only messages-file mutator; both are discovered as siblings of this
  file and invoked as subprocesses. All session state lands under
  ``--output-dir`` — this driver creates no files anywhere else.
- **Path confinement**: every serviced path is resolved and required to stay
  inside the resolved corpus root (a trust boundary — traversal and symlink
  escapes are refused).

INVARIANT: stdlib only. No third-party dependencies. Ever.

usage sketch:
  relay-driver.py --corpus-root kb-root --system-prompt doctrine.md \\
      --questions-file questions.md --question-number all \\
      --output-dir eval-out --env-file guest.env

Connection env vars (``API_BASE_URL``, ``MODEL``, ``API_KEY_FILE``) are
``post-openai.py``'s contract, inherited from the environment or injected
via ``--env-file`` (KEY=VALUE lines). The API key file path is passed
through opaquely; this driver never reads or prints key material.

Output layout under ``--output-dir`` (the as-run qNN structure):
  session/qNN/messages.json    full conversation (audit-permanent)
  session/qNN/usage.jsonl      USAGE_STATS_FILE side channel, one line/call
  session/qNN/tmp/             scratch (msg-util content files, TMPDIR)
  answers/qNN.md               the guest's FINAL report (or a liaison note)
  answers/stats.csv            per-question round trips, token totals, outcome
